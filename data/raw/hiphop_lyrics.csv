[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

[Intro]
Man, duke, I was in love with this girl, duke
I was tore up, dog, I'm tellin' you, man
Shit is wild, man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

[Verse 1]
Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name, love? Where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up
Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""A-yo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!)
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin'? ""Oh, I'm fine"", my name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""

[Interlude]
She blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though
I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just..
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me..

[Verse 2]
""Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby, you know what it's like, some brothers don't be comin' right""
I understand, I'm feelin' you
Besides, ""Can I have a dance?"" ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singin' Gregory Isaacs
Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man, I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., ""Come now"", I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart, I got to have it
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next mornin', she gone like it was magic
Aww, damn it! My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some bangin' ass Asian playin' lay it down and lick me up
What!?54Embed"

Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 1]
Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let's see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass 'til MCs get weak
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep
'Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a President's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MCs wanna beef, then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

[Hook]

They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped and wrecked
But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to labs to observe 'em
They couldn't absorb 'em, they didn't deserve 'em
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak, just seek
And peep the technique

[Hook]
Never sweat the technique

[Verse 3]
I speak indiscreet 'cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new 'cause it's real
And in a while the style’ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs
For all the years, you fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique
[Hook]
Never sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir

You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say see ya, ‘cause I would never be ya
Be an officer? You wicked overseer!
You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?

Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checkin' out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word overseer, like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doing?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wan' check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‘cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nyah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it

Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a D.A.I.S.Y. Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One? (Plug One)
Now don't worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me, I know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

[Chorus: Steely Dan]
I know I'll love you better

[Verse 2: Dove]
May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak?
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two (Is Plug Two)
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true (True)
You might also like[Chorus: Steely Dan]
I know I'll love you better

[Verse 3: Pos]
Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul (Soul)
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing (In full swing)
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
I know you'll be close to me 'cause

[Chorus: Steely Dan]
I know I'll love you better
[Verse 4: Dove]
It's I again, and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'til we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we can meet Mr. Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
""Let the wedding begin"" (The wedding begin)
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're deaf
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you possess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

Yo, Chuck, bust a move, man
I was on my way up here to the studio
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
And this brother stopped me and asked me, ""Yo, wassup with that brother, Chuckie D? He swear he nice""
I said ""Yo, the brother don't swear he's nice, he knows he's nice""
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
So Chuck, I got a feelin you turning him into a Public Enemy, man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me
On the way out to LA Laurelton Queens?
While we was in the car on our way to the Shop?
Well yo, right now kick the bass for them brothers
And let 'em know
What goes on!

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
Rolling Stones of the rap game, not bragging
Lips bigger than Jagger, not saggin'
Spell it backwards, I'ma leave it at that
That ain't got nothing to do with rap
Check the facts, expose those cats
Who pose as heroes and take advantage of blacks
Your government's gangster, so cut the crap
A war going on so where y'all at?
""Fight the Power"" comes great responsibility
'F the Police' but who's stopping you from killing me?
Disaster, fiascos over a loop by P.E
If it's an I instead of we believing TV
Spitting riches, bitches, and this new thing about snitches
Watch them asses move as the masses switches
System dissed them but barely missed her
My sole intention to save my brothers and sisters

Screamin gangsta twenty years later
Of course endorsed while consciousness faded
New generation believin them fables
""Gangster Boogie"" on two turntables
Show no love so it's easy to hate it
Desecrated while the coroner waited
Any given Sunday, so where y'all rate it?
Wit slavery, lynchin, and them drugs infiltrated
I'm like that doll Chucky, baby
Keep comin back to live, love life like I'm crazy
Keep it movin Rising to the Top

So you too can review what we do
Twenty years in this business, How You Sell Soul?

Thank you for lettin us be ourselves
So don't mind me if I repeat myself

This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock a rhyme that's right on time, ""It's Tricky"" is the title (Here we go)

[Chorus: Rev Run, DMC, & Both]
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tr-tr-tr-tricky, tricky, tricky

[Verse 1: DMC & Rev Run]
I met this little girlie, her hair was kind of curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is, ""Please me""
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said, ""It's not that easy""

[Chorus: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it D?)
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky

[Verse 2: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
In New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really hawk, but we just walk because we have no time
And in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside

Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky, huh

[Verse 3: DMC & Rev Run]
When I wake up, people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father 'cause he's down with me

[Chorus: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it?)
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky

[Outro: DMC, Rev Run, & Both]
We are not thugs, we don't use drugs, but you assume on your own
They offer coke and lots of dope, but we just leave it alone

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

I shot the sheriff

(""Don't get too close because you might get shot"")

I shot the sheriff

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric - it's hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(Don't sleep on the E) You see, somethin' might rupture
It don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge.. cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus.. EPMD's in town

[Parrish Smith]
Total chaos -- no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizin' known to cause an illusion
Like a magician.. who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 Magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
It's travellin' the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening.. plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the Twilight Zone
You're terrified.. plus you can't bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, in the Land of the Lost
You start to shiver.. but then you scream, my friend
Yo, wake up Muttley, because you're dreamin' again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm Strictly Business

I shot the sheriff

[Erick Sermon]
This is the rap season.. where the E starts pleasin'
Girls around the world no need to be skeezin'
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case.. a brother acts a fool
I've got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor..
(Get busy, boy) Like you never saw before
Rhyme flow, good to go
After the show I'll pull your ho, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow?) .. Hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
And my parents find out, then they start riffin'
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the E.. the R-I-C-K

[Parrish Smith]
MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends.. heart rate increases
It's like beam me up, Scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as AIDS when it's time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once -- then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, ""How high?""
Because I'm takin' no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
You're just a soldier.. and I'm a Green Beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this:
Bring your dog, mom, and dad.. because I'm Strictly Business
[Hook]
I shot the sheriff

[Erick Sermon]
Yo yo, you're still pickin' on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the Sandman, sucker.. because it's over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turnin' and my so-called friends
They smile in my face -- behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff -- because they don't have cash
Like the E-Double.. or the PMD
He drives a Corvette, I drive a Samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith.. with the key to fame
Never high on myself -- always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back -- fatigued? No, I'm not

[Parrish Smith]
Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxin'
Or relaxin' -- just reactin' and subtractin'
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yappin' and flappin'
I lose my cool, then I'll start slappin' and smackin'
You wanna roll? Then Albee start jackin' and cappin'
No time to lounge, I'm packin' and strappin'
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and bitin' is illegal
So next time in town, I highly recommend this
You gots to chill, because I'm Strictly Business5Embed"

But you never look my way (Hey!)

In every single way (Hey!)

And a green card's on the way
This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit
Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom

Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho 'round

That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark

From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns

That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us

Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew

Step through troops and leave proof

People thinkin' MC is shorthand for misconception
Let me meditate, set it straight
Came to the conclusion that most of these cats is featherweight
Let me demonstrate:
Walkin' the streets is like battlin'; be careful with your body
You must know karate and think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituaries
Third-grade teacher readin' and talkin' about, ""I knew he'd amount to nothin'""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type, who'd have thought they was frontin'?""
Talkin' loud like you on RCA
Get carted away with body parts and trays
What a way to start your day, yo, it's like...

[Hook: Mos Def]
One, two, three (C'mon!)
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top (C'mon!)
Best alliance in hip-hop! Y-O!
I said one, two, three
It's kinda dangerous to be a MC (C'mon!)
They shot 2Pac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O!
[Verse 3: Mos Def]
I said Manhattan keep on makin' it, Brooklyn keep on takin' it
So relax, we're takin' it back, Red Hook where we're livin' at
Plenty cats be strugglin', not hustlin' and bubblin'
It ain't about production, then, what is we discussin'?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Strivin' for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose
Colossal! True, original b-boy apostle
Standin' on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo

[Verse 4: Talib Kweli]
You think you the shit? Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or clique
Or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry
Without a history of spittin' the epitome of stupidity
Livin' my life, expressin' my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of equality
People follow me, and other cats, they hear him flow
And assume I'm the real one with the lyrics like I'm Cyrano

[Verse 5: Mos Def]
Still sippin' wishing well water imported from Pluto
Three-hundred-and-sixty milliliters for all the believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats cannot precede us
In the jungle with the leaders — we them lions, you the cheetahs
Our cypher will complete us as we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us, and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus! Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up — think it over, ease up!

Put your hands way up in the air

[Verse: Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg]
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug through your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
A place where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 30 years makin' rap tunes
Say what?
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '22, they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city gettin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep, it's always drama in the club
Yeah they heard I - with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem you get plenty of groupie love
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey man, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, fo sho they'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)

I recognize you're looking at me for the pay stub
But homicide looking at you from the face down
MAC-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'—let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty, uh, uh, is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearing on my record
Tell 'em I'm a gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I—
Won't you please believe when I—

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, down before
Ah, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""

[""Lose Yourself"" — Eminem]

[Intro]
Whoa
If you had one shot
One opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted
One moment—would you capture it?

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better…
(Lose yourself)
Los Angeles, make some noise!
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better…

It's still Dre Day (Ah?) AK (Ah?)
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How, homie, my last album was The Chronic?
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game (Still)
Still puffin' my leaves, still touchin' the beats
Still not lovin' police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed (Still)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A. 
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck—

Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest (*Battering ram*)
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em! (Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say
[Chorus]
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police (The verdict)

[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker

Word (But tonight—)

[Verse 1]
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rocking my peers, putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now?
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh), breakdown

Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Uh)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Huh)

[Verse 3]
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio
Uh, I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane
Starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain
I maintain unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing, digging and drilling a hole
Pass the ol' gold

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
[Verse 4]
Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you
Understand that I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh, listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage, uh, damage, uh
Damage, uh, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy-soft sucka, I'll slay him
Farmers (What?) Farmers (What?)
I'm ready (We ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard

[Chorus]
Knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

[Intro]
Break 'em
Shit
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)
See Ice Cube LiveGet tickets as low as $65You might also like[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven, seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', ""Domino""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.​
Today was a good day (Shit)

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day (Shit)

Look, I love her curves but what's more preferred
Is the way she articulates words
Can't help observe and stare when she in the mirror
Masking the massacre while she fixing her hair
I mean, she’s so perfect in her own little world
We built the foundation, everything I want in a girl
And it's a matter of time until her last name mine
You got potential baby, just imagine us combined
I wanna see you shine like the gem that you are
Want you be so secure that they can see from afar
That you don't need not a man, and you can stand on your own
Let's keep stacking your bread and one day, we gon' get gone
And get away from here
You're the only reason I be staying here

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Now in my younger days, I used to sport a shag
When I went to school, I carried lunch in a bag
With a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name, then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday, but still, I had to let her pass
[Chorus: Fatlip]
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)

When I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly
See, she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga, but
All I could do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by

[Verse 3: Imani]
Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me, ""Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop""
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I proved to be a better man

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
""My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me, but I know you
Very well, now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man, then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed ""Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender""
The letter came back three days later ""Return to Sender"", damn

She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)

Drake and Future LyricsHi, I’m the Rap Critic. Well… Lil Wayne has a new single, and it’s called “Love Me”. Well, with a title like that, I don’t know what to expect. However, after “How to Love” turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life, maybe a song titled “Love Me” would be a more personal number. Contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships. And yeah, it could just be another crappy bragging song, but I like to be optimistic when I go into a review. So... what? That’s not the full title of the song? What’s the full title of the song?

Drake: Bitches love me

Man, I feel stupid. Well, let’s get this over with

Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
-stupid, unnecessary audio watermark for the producer-

*sneers*

I don’t know what I was doing-

Wait. What was that thing she’s wearing? Is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle? A mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much? Wow, we’ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory, haven’t we? I mean… you know what, I haven’t even started talking about the lyrics yet. I’m just gonna let this one go

Okay, so this song, which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit, is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex. And…maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff! Like, you know, headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now. Or swing sets. Yeah…

Future: Imma ball ‘til the day I fall

One more thing before we continue. When did this Future character here, a guy who barely passes as a rapper, let alone a singer, become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy? I mean, according to what I’m seeing on the lyric sheet, he has no verse! So without his own full verse, the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook. And I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but…

(shows a cover of the single for “Loveeee Song” by Future and Rihanna as that song plays)

Future isn’t exactly a powerhouse vocalist. I mean, could Lil Wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks? Aren’t you still friends with T-Pain? At least that guy has some personality, this guy is… huh. Funny that a guy named Future is relying on a vocal effect that’s near extinction. I mean, when even T-Pain says...

T-Pain: Auto tune is on its way out!
You might also likeBack in 2008, I think it’s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously. But back to the song

Drake: Long as my bitches love, my bitches love

Wait, now Drake is on the chorus? Is this the Drake and Future collaboration the world was waiting for? He doesn’t have a verse either, so I can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting. But forgive me again, we need to get back to the song

Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me

So the song is about how he doesn’t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him. Which is typical, but for some reason, in this song he’s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky, confident braggadocio. Actually listen to the song without the arrogant, too cool to care faces in the music video. And really listen to their voices:

Future: I’m on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call

Is there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess? I mean, if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is, that would be perfect, but it’s not. And usually, failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that’s full of vigor and 808, but he can’t do that here, since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that’s present on nearly every friggin’ song featuring Drake, and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens, their lifeless delivery stops the song dead!

Drake: I can give a fuck ‘bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me

Does he actually sound convinced here? Does he legitimately sound like he doesn’t care about haters? I don’t know about you guys, but to me it sounds like he’s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve. All I hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess! And we haven’t even gotten to the verses yet!

Lil Wayne: Pussy ass niggas, stop hating

So, you don’t care about haters in any way, shape or form, and only care about your women... but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters. Because you know, what better way to show that you don’t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them?

(montage of Wayne mentioning haters throughout the song)
I don’t know about you, but there’s something slightly contradictory about shouting, “HEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU!”

Lil Wayne: Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man!

D-do hoes like Satan? I mean, I know hoes are known for having questionable morality, but I don’t think anyone actively likes Satan. I don’t even think Satanists likes Satan, they just do it to piss off Christians. I mean I know you’re trying to relate the Satan and fire thing, but hoes don’t like fire either!

Lil Wayne: And these hoes love me like Satan, man!

You know, believe it or not, but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that Lil Wayne is part of some demonic cult. And honestly, if you think some post-production CGI inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think Lil Wayne works for the devil... then he does work for the devil... and he’s going to kill you

Lil Wayne: Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she’s on a strict diet

You don’t know how segways work, do you? I mean, what thought process takes you from “I’m going to kill you!” to “This chick is all about my penis.” For real! The only piece of transitional material we get is the word “and”. And I don’t know about you, but linking two phrases together with the word “and” is not the same as a transitional phrase, and I like nipples

Lil Wayne: She don’t want money
She wants the time we could spend

Pfft. Yeah, okay. Lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you!

Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”
Okay… I’m, I’m trying to explain what’s wrong with these lines, and what disturbs me about them. Because it’s not just about the fact that they’re objectifying the girl in question. No, that’s to be expected with Wayne. But it’s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that. And I just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question:

Lil Wayne: She said, “I never wanna make you mad
I just wanna make you proud”
I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”

In what way does this NOT sound like an abusive relationship? In what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who’s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her? I mean it’s not overtly stating it, but it’s definitely implied. (sees a shot of a woman in the scolds bridle) Wow. That is not helping. But anyway, in his episode of Behind the Music, he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him, and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that. If this is true, it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself. And you know what? He’s an artist, and an artist telling you about his perspective doesn't always have to be a positive thing

But my problem lies not in his questionable morals…well actually yes it does, but it’s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular, plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls! I mean, he’s making no bones about the fact that he doesn’t respect you, so at this point, if you’re still trying to get with him, your motivations are probably no better than his, and I think you know what I mean when I talk about the motivations of these types of women. You know, those women, always wanting to spend all of your time…

Lil Wayne: She wants the time we could spend

*scoff* Heartless succubus. But hey, maybe he’s not that bad. Maybe when he’s with these women, he’s actually respectful of the... I’m sorry, are there women in cages like circus animals? So…let me get this straight. Lupe Fiasco makes a song that barely charts, talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects, and should hold themselves to a higher standard, and he’s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff. But Lil Wayne has a top 10 hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages?! With lines like...

Lil Wayne: I said, “Baby just make me cum
Then don’t make a sound”

And… nobody’s making a stink about this! I’m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything, I just think it’s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on, while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay. But where was I? Oh, yes. So like I was saying, I’m sure in real life, Wayne is very respectful to women…

Lil Wayne: These hoes got pussies like craters

Damn! That…that imagery! Again, to all the women still wanting to have sex with Lil Wayne: THIS is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas! *picture of a crater* So…I think he’s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you’re all whores!

Lil Wayne: Can’t treat these hoes like ladies, man!

Hey…who do you treat like a lady? Because by acknowledging the idea of lady, you’re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status. But none of the girls you’ve ever met have achieved that status in your head. So it’s not that you’re saying that all women are whores; you’re just saying that all women you refer to are whores. Hmm... I wonder how that works for other things

""I’m not saying that all Chinese people are good at math, play piano and know Kung Fu, I’m just saying that all the Chinese people I’m ever going to refer to are good at math, play piano and know Kung-where’s everybody going?""

Lil Wayne: Pussy, money, weed, codeine

Was that a lyric, or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to?

Lil Wayne: She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed: 69, 96

Wait. What do those last numbers have to do with anything? Are you saying that you and her are 69’ing each other? Well that doesn’t work, since you only mention that she’s going down on you! And what is 96 supposed to mean?! Do you know why it’s called 69, Wayne? Because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other. So what is 96 supposed to represent? Two people…facing away from each other? What, are they lying on each other’s butts? That makes no sense!

Lil Wayne: I feel her heartbeat

It’s a little late to get romantic, don’t you think?

Lil Wayne: I chest to chest with this bitch

Yeah, I thought so

Lil Wayne: Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it’s like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses

Hold on a minute, maybe the song’s trying to say something. Maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn’t actually lead to a fulfilling life. And maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet! Of course there’s no real revelation, he just continues to talk about haters and hoes

Lil Wayne: Now kiss my ass if you hatin
I’m getting ass or I’m skating

Anything that keeps you from playing the guitar. *shows a scene of Wayne playing the guitar live* Yeah, keep hitting those two notes, buddy. I’m sure the people who play the Beginner mode on Guitar Hero are impressed

Yeah, overall, this gets a 0 out of 5 from me. The melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song, which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it. And the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat! And his rhymes are terrible. There’s no wordplay here that’s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist. It crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance. And ultimately, does not make for a good listening experience

And that’s pretty much all I have to say about that. Well, I’m the Rap Critic. You don’t have to like my opinion, but I don’t have to like your song

Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything, man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit up, this shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you, B.I.G. 
Can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yeah, this right here (Tell me why)
Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
It seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
You might also like[Chorus: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (I miss you, B.I.G.)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)
Know you in Heaven, smilin' down (Ha)
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death
[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Every step I take
Every move I make (I miss you)
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Thinkin' of the day
When you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you (Somebody tell me why)

[Interlude: Faith Evans]
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

[Outro: 112, Puff Daddy & Faith Evans]
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take (Every day that passes is a day that I get closer)
Every move I make, every single day (To seeing you again)
Every night I pray, every step I take (We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop 'cause we can't stop)
Every move I make, every single day (That's right)
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day (We miss you, B.I.G)

We just eating good

That's how it’s supposed to be

[Verse 1: Andrew]
Hey, let me tell you about a place out east
Just Fifteen minutes from the LA streets
Hollywood doesn’t even know we exist
Like it's a mystical land, filled with immigrants
The food's authentic, the price is perfect
Where restaurants focus on the taste not service
Be ready to share 'cause it's family style
Time with the fam, makes granny proud!

We're far enough from LA where nobody's actin' phony!
Except maybe on our taxes, it’s cash only!
Tell the health department stop hating
’Cause a B rating stands for better tasting
Where kids drink more milk tea than liquor
And they roast more duck than Swishers
It's the 6-2-6, man check the address
Home of Sriracha and Panda Express

[Chorus: Jason Chen/Andrew]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea

[Verse 3: Andrew & David]
Sometimes I wonder, am I still in America
How come there’s still a language barrier?
If you need help, read Yelp, check the reviews
My Elite friends make it easy to choose
There's traditional rivalries between high schools
They started back when there was still some white dudes
No matter where you go they can't match the price
So you're always coming back to the Cafe Life
If J-Town's got sake and K-Town soju
What do we have? Oh yea we got bobas
Hot spots to get some, hot pot and dim sum
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
From Shanghai to Saigon, Tokyo to Taiwan
Beijing to Hong Kong something to bite on
Valley, Atlantic, Garvey, I drive on
3 in the morning, cafes got their lights on

[Chorus: Jason Chen]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good

Alright, stop what you're doin' 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
I look funny, but yo, I'm making money, see
So, yo, world, I hope you're ready for me
Now gather 'round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I'll drink up all the Hennessy you got on your shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with an, ""Umpty""
Yo, ladies, oh, how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten, please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky, I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick with this
Straight gangster mack, but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Ayo, fat girl, come here, are you ticklish?
Yeah, I called you fat, look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly, but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Doing the Humpty Hump, come on)
Do the Humpty Hump (Ha), do the Humpty Hump

[Verse 2]
People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's alright 'cause I get things cookin'
You stare, you glare, you constantly try to compare me
But you can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls, they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
'Cause in a 69, my humpty nose will tickle your rear
My nose is big, uh-uh, I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, you know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I'll shoot an arrow like Cupid
I'll use a word that don't mean nothing like, ""Looptid""
I sang on, ""Doowutchyalike,"" and if you missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'em in the biscuits""
Also told you that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All you had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance
[Chorus]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump (Come on, yeah, sexy lady)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on, uh), do the Humpty Hump (Sexy baby, everybody)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump (Uh)

Do the Humpty Hump (Watch me), do the Humpty Hump

[Interlude]
Ah yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let a little bit of that bass groove right here
Err-rear, der-rit, err-rear, der-rit
Ah, yeah
Now that I told y'all a little bit about myself
Let me tell you a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do, check it out

[Verse 3]
First I limp to the side like my legs was broken
Shaking and twitching kind of like I was smoking
Crazy, whack, funky
People say, ""You look like MC Hammer on crack, Humpty""
That's alright 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
You got it down when you appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin'
Gig around, shaking your rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stunt
Tell him, ""Step off, I'm doing the Hump""
[Chorus]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump (Everybody, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump (Come on and), do the Humpty Hump (Sexy lady, uh)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Do you know what I'm doing? We're doing the Humpty Hump, y'all, uh, watch me)
Do the Humpty Hump (Uh), do the Humpty Hump (Yo, yo, Black people)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Come on, white people)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Puerto Ricans)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Just keep on doing the Hump, Samoans)
Do the Humpty Hump (Do the), do the Humpty Hump

[Interlude]
Ah, yeah
Let's get stupid (Give me the music)
Uh

[Chorus]
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Give me— Give me the music, everybody)
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump (Uh, give me— Give me the music)

He reached for his pistol, but it was just a waste
'Cause my nine millimeter was up against his face
He pulled his pistol anyway and I filled him full of lead
But just before he fell to the ground this is what I said

[Chorus]
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, ayy
Listen to my nine millimeter go bang

[Verse 2]
Seven days later, I was chillin' in the herb gate
But seven days too much when the gossip has to circulate
Puffin' sinsemilla, I heard ""knock, knock, knock""
But the way that they knocked it did not sound like any cop
And if it were a customer, they'd ask me for a nick'
So suddenly I realized it had to be a trick
I dropped down to the floor and they did not waste no time
They shot right through the door so I had to go for mine
They pumped and shot again, but the suckas kept on missin'
'Cause I was on the floor by now, I crawled into the kitchen
Thirty seconds later, boy, they bust the door down
The money and the sinsemi' was lyin' all around
But just as they put their pistols down to take a cut
Me jumped out the kitchen, went ""buck, buck, buck""
They fall down to the floor, but one was still alive
So I put my nine millimeter right between his eyes
Looked at his partner and both of them were dead
So just before he joined his partner, this is what I said
[Chorus]
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, ayy

[Verse 3]
I gathered all the money and I ran up the block
I said ""This is a perfect time to meet with Scott La Rock""
But Scott is either psychic or he has a knack for trouble
'Cause Scott La Rock showed up in a all-black BMW
I jumped inside the car and we screeched off in a hurry
And Scott said, ""What is wrong? Relax, tell me the story""
I said ""You remember Peter? Well, his posse tried to kill me
I'm all right now because the sinsemi' fill me""
Scott just laughed, he said, ""I know they're all dead
And just before you pulled the trigger this is what you said""

We, like the breeze, flow straight out of our lids
Them, they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us, floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop record
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms, man, boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion?
Where kinky hair goes, to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly? 'Cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked the light blue suede Pumas
What by the cut, we push it off the corner
How was the buzz, entire hip-hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' junky rhythms right down your block
We be to rap what key be to lock

[Chorus: Butterfly]

He gives the strangest smile, so I say, ""Hi"" (What's up?)
Who understood? Yeah, understood the plans
Him, heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip, let borders get loose
How to consume all the beats just like juice
If it's the shit, we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic, hip-hop gains a classic

[Intro]
Regulators. We regulate any stealin' of his property. We’re damn good too. But you can’t be any geek off the street. You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean. Earn your keep. Regulators, mount up!

[Verse 1: Warren G & Nate Dogg]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryna find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213
So, I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck!""
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

[Verse 2: Warren G & Nate Dogg]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brothers, said ""Damn, what's next?""
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode

I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child
Were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, ""Ooh, I like your size!""
She said, ""My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

We're sitting here with Eazy-E
Believe that
How are you doing?
Alright
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster?

[Verse 1: Eazy-E, & Regina King]
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin', I specialized in gankin'
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun​
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo, I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-four Impala
Rollin' and runnin' from the police
Brother, don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal?
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
Eazy-E, were you ever caught slipping? Hell nah
Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches, I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
Out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

Sometimes
Okay, what would be the situation when you so-call ""gank"" someone?
[Verse 2]
Waitin' for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in, all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow 'cause it takes timing
Looked around and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
'Cause you know, it's no time for shakin'
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin' and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key and I flee
Out the back with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall, don't fall
Wipe my sweat 'cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?
[Interlude: Regina King, & Eazy-E]
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, an armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two-eleven?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Eazy-E, & Regina King]
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
Were you slick? Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said, ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of Zig-Zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy-E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said, ""Punch it""
Took the gun and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true? I don't lie
You see, I'm not Mr. Nice Guy
[Interlude: Regina King, & Eazy-E]
Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy-E think of himself?

[Outro: Eazy-E, & Regina King]
Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Taught, and damn sure bought

Saint, I’m a sinner, prize, I’m a winner
And it’s you, what can I do to deserve that?
Paper, baby, I’ll be the pen
Say that I’m the one 'cause you are ten
Real and not pretend

[Chorus: Miguel]
Even when the sky comes falling, even when the sun don’t shine
I got faith in you and I, so put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we’re down to the wire, babe, even when it’s do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
She my sure thing, my second only pure thing
It’s like heaven when I’m untying them bra strings
See I’m drawn to her, horse and carriage like
Daydreaming got me thinking, what is marriage like?
She like Terrance Wright, I’m booking Paris Flights
The Hermes H bangles that I heard you like
Say the words and it’s there
You put up with the rumors and they blog what you wear
His-and-her everything, charge for the pair
Couldn’t let you cluster when I’m all solitaire’s
Share and share alike, I never fear the price
Top of my game, I hope you ain't scared of heights
Roll a dice, you can bet that, never gotta sweat that
Pony hair, Louboutins, let you pet that
Ferrari engine like the trunk got a jet pack
Looking pretty on my arm's what you best at
Push!
[Chorus: Miguel]
Even when the sky comes falling, even when the sun don’t shine
I got faith in you and I, so put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we’re down to the wire, babe, even when it’s do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

[Outro: Miguel]
Know you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover1Embed"

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!)

On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call I'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Verse 3]
Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining, man, he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
[Chorus]
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night

[Intro]
Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!

[Verse 1]
Just. Like. Uniblab
Robotic kickin' flab
My flavor bidder badder, chitter-chatter madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now, hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MCs need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you and I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kickin' out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say ""Craig Mack"" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 2]
Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue, to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
‘Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Chorus]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
[Verse 3]
Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and…

[Chorus]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear27Embed"

I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

[Verse 1: Scarface]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me
[Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]
This year, Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!
My mind is playin' tricks on me96Embed"

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 1: Melle Mel]
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car
[Chorus: Melle Mel]
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 2: Melle Mel]
Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady livin' in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watching all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so, so saditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

[Verse 3: Duke Bootee]
My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane
[Chorus: Duke Bootee]
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
[Verse 4: Duke Bootee]
My son said, ""Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say, 'You want some more?' Livin' on a see-saw""
[Chorus: Duke Bootee]
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head (Say what?)
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
[Verse 5: Melle Mel]
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, ""I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool""
But then you wind up droppin' out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null and void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so
[Chorus: Melle Mel]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh

Gotta expose me like that, why don'tchu? God damn, so, so you were tellin' me a little about this ""Canvas"" thing, um (Hiei witcha gun, eye 'cause I see clear, clear)
I'm over here thinking, ""Yo, does he have a project in between?"", ""Is he starting a new collective, as he does every, every three weeks or—"", haha, ""Is it like—, like I, I don't know, like, what, what is it he's doing? Is it some song?""
And, um… turns out, it's a meme, tell me about that, ha, ha, everybody—, yo, I never, I never really really thought that this would be, the word
Or the phrase, that my music that kinda takes me off, ha, right, yeah, but, lo and behold, it is, um, as you should know
'Cause, like, it's show how relevant that song is, that's the number, uh, that's one of them, uh—, number one songs on iTunes out of Trap Ketchum, it starred
Right, um, of course you're referring to um—, ooh, that's crazy it's starred, I Don't Understand It
I Don't Understand It, yeah, um, the fifth installment in the, I lack knowledge about the current subject matter, heh, line that you have
Yesssss, you're fav', haha, yeah, it is, it is my favorite off that project, um, so you were saying? But, yeah, fuckin', heh, the line, I started my verse—, what happened?
Yeah, the line in your verse, yeah, I just start—, ""Canvas?! Smeargle, I paint on the canvas"", ""Hop—"", ""—and do damage, Sableye, bitch, I'm a bandit, I'm robbin' yo' granny""
Kinda just started with ""Canvas?!"", and, that was the first instance that all of shofu's fans heard me scream, right
Or be loud, right, 'cause, like, a lotta, a lotta, uh, a, a lot of listeners of Trap Ketchum were, like, people who have never heard of my shit before
So it's like, that was probably my, like, my best performance, on that? And, um, it's kinda crazy, man, because, like, I never really would have thought, that that—, 'cause, like, I-I-I-I really felt—
'Cause I'm on Trap Ketchum four times, right, I felt like Kami Clouds, the bonus track I was on, would do a lot better, uhm, uh, okay, that's interesting, uh, but I Don't Understand It became the star of the show
And everybody just started hitting my D-M's with ""CANVAS"" in all caps, and, there's a ""Canvas!"" emote in shofu's Twitch server now, *Tongue Clicking*, haha, that's the funniest thing yet, and, um, people would donate on stream to shofu just to hear me scream ""Canvas""
Right, like, it's come a long way and I-I don't regret it because, like, it's really cool, yeah, but it's like ""Really, man?"", like, ""Am I just a canvas gimmick now?"", like it feels like a, it feels like a—, ""You're a living meme!""
It feels like a fuckin' gimmick, man, I don't know what to tel—, I-I don't know what else to say about it, and, um, I'm glad you're embracing it though… at least on your [?], oh, of course, it's fire
Yeah, I just hop in—, and it also gives me an excuse to scream, yeah, all the time, 'cause like, literally, there's, ah, so many instances where people come into shofu's server just screaming
And they either get banned, right, or they get yelled at, or they get both, uhm, and if I hop in and scream ""Canvas"", not only will people scream ""Canvas"" with me, but, uh, they'll laugh, yeah
And so I basically have a free card to scream wherever I go, heheh, um, which is my favorite activity, I'll have you know that, um
That's, when you're not, vaping, 25/8, heheh, heheheh, you're probably, like, screaming into your said vape, oh, of course, you know, you just gotta combine the two, heheh, but nah, it's, dude, it's, it's crazy, and that's what really blew me up
Like, I-I—, after Trap Ketchum dropped, I literally went up, like, maybe three-hundred followers on Twitter
Ooh, okay, that's interesting, yeah, I was gonna ask like, what'v—, what've been the consequences? But literally, like, how have you benefitted? Um, not that you're doing this for clout
I've gon' up like—, but, you know? Nah, it's—, shofu's actually a really cool dude, man, he—, I met him, through a Twitter interaction because he heard one of my songs and liked it
Um, and I—, I'm assuming it's, uh, the LIKE RED track, right? Yeah, which is actually—, even though HOP UP OFF MY WAVE dropped first, that was actually the first sh-shit he did was, he remixed LIKE RED, right
But, um… fuckin'—, he's a really cool dude, man, and, like, we just made music for the fuck of it, like I didn't have to be on Trap Ketchum four times, nor did I ask… to be clouted up
We just work together very well, uhm-hm, and, um, make shit happen, but, um, yeah, my Twitter followers has gone up, my Twitter, um, activity has gone up a lot, ""Straight up!"", but people—, yea—, don't even get me started on Travis Scott, heh
Um, haha, a lot of people interact with my Twitter more, it kinda gave me more of a public face, uhm-hm, um, I went from getting like ten followers on SoundCloud a day to like fifty to one-hundred somethin' followers on SoundCloud a day, okay
Like, geez, I'm goin' up a lot, like it's crazy and, uhm-hm, like, all my songs are gettin'—, doin' great numbers
Um, it's weird though, and, like, I was talkin' to one of my homeboys about this yesterday, is that… every time I collab' wit' shofu, new people are hearing it, and it's like, yeah, I have to reinvent myself again
And, like, one of my friends asked me, they're like ""Yo, you have all these new songs out, why is TROUBLE IN PARADISE 2 back up on your spotlight?""
I'm like ""Well, all these new fans"", they don't know, ""Hear me, hear me on Trap Ketchum, hear me on HOP UP OFF MY WAVE, hear me on all this shit, and they don't know about that shit""
Yeah, I literally met someone today on, on Pokémon Showdown! 'cause his, his, uh, his fuckin', tag was a lyric from one of Trap Ketchum's songs and I was like, oooooh, ""It's me, PE$O PETE, what's up?""
And, um, I was linking him songs that, like, he should know about, but he just—, he like—, songs that me and shofu have done on my SoundCloud and he, he hasn't even heard those, so there's like a whole demographic that I haven't touched yet, so like it's kinda cool
Yeah, no, that's, that, I—, yeah, no, that's, that's really awesome, um, I was talkin' to, um, Laye and Louv about that yesterday that, um, something that's important is, like, expanding the demographic
And, I mean, I don't know exactly how wildly different is it, like, the people listen to—, that have been listening to you and the people that listen to shofu, but, you know? New people is always a good thing, right? Um, yeah
No, tha—, that—, that's awesome, um, and, yeah, I like, I like that you get that chance, you know? Uh, now, even a new feature you get with him, or vice versa, like, you know? That—, you, you get, like, a bajillion new first impressions, on like what you sound like
It's crazy, it's, it's, it's really cool, I don't know, and, like, what a lot of people don't know is that… I grew up on shofu's videos, I been watching shofu's YouTube channel since sixth grade, uhm-hm, I have, I have merchandise, yeah-yeah
Like, uh, I—, dude, like, wh—, like I told him after we made HOP OFF UP MY WAVE!, I was like ""Yo, like I'm not just some nigga out here makin' Pokémon music, like you're one of my inspirations, like I've been watching your shit for like… fat, like a fat amount of time""
Heh, like, yeah-yeah, and like the other day when I got to be in one of his Pokémon Showdown!, uh, YouTube videos, I immediately sent the link to one of my high school friends and I was like ""Yo"", ""Peep, [?] game!""
""We used to watch these shits in, like, fifth period"", yeah, ""And, like, laugh about it, and, like, here I am, like I, I came full circle"", no, that's cool, and obviously it's, obviously it's just the first step in my journey, yes, but it's definitely a great first step
Yeah, no, that's, that's good that you have it in mind, um… but, yeah, no, I-I'm sure that feels cool, you're on the platform that you were once… looking at, you were watching on YouTube I should say, uh, yeah, it's crazy, man
But you know that's, that's all irrelevant, we just wanna know about, uh, TIP 3, right? Aw, god, um, listen, man, no, I'm kidding, um, we'll get there when we get there, it's on the way, uh, it's on the way, I don't care, uh, um
So, MELTYPETE, hahaha, uh, let's talk about that, uh, so, how-how-how-how do you feel about it? Its release? How it did? Do you have a, a favorite song? 'Cause obviously on Trap Ketchum, I mean, everybody's favorite song and… you know? Even mine is that: I Don't Understand It or whatever, but…
Now moving to the most recent project of yours, well, well, how do you feel about it? What's—, looking back at it, well, what do you think? Um, I feel like it was a failure, failure but?! All in all, okay, heheh, um, I don't know, we had such high hopes for it, it did well
Response was always positive because my fans are just… a bunch of fuckin' idiot—, I'm joking, I fucking love all of you, heh, but like, um, response was good, okay, but like, I feel like it was a failure all in all, I felt like it could have been a lot bigger
I felt like I was aiming for a more mainstream sound, and I didn't get the mainstream response in which I wanted… that's—, so you're saying, like, maybe critically, people like—, no one, like, out here hated it, but… maybe it didn't catch the attention that you wanted or do exactly the numbers you wanted or somethin'?
Yeah, I mean, it was fun to make, me and melty had a fun time doin' that shit, okay, um, it started off as like an idea just for—, to get more traction 'cause melty's one of my, like, biggest cosigns, clout [?], he's one of my, yeah, he's one of my biggest cosigners besides shofu
That nigga has stupid clout, yeah, and he's also one of my homeboys and, like, you know? I been wanting to do a project with him for a while after I dropped CANT THINK STR8, yeah, and, um… which, by the way, favorite song off the project, personally, it's also my most-played song to date
Oh, really? What's it at? Like forty-seven thousand, forty-eight thousand, oh wow, oka—, I mean, that's—, I think well deserved, prolly the closest thing you have to like… something that could ea—, like you could slip it right into the radio and it's like ""Oh yeah, I mean, this fits, you know? This is good""
Yeah, that was kinda the whole point of MELTYPETE was to get me some more radio-type songs, okay, uh, somethin' a li'l more mainstream, somethin' that's eas—, like that could be easily marketed, right, no, uh, I get—, yeah, okay, but… I don't know, it—
And I might be wrong, but I remember when I was looking back at, like, first-month stats, uhm-hm, it was like par with, like—, obviously not counting the two singles that obviously did hella plays: EVERYDAY! and CANT THINK STR8, it was—, I think AFTER IT ALL was still beating it with likes
Like it was—, ohhhhh, it was slow, so—, which is a different feeling 'cause I-I'm used to—, obviously this is me being [?] ego nightmare, no-no, 'cause I'm used, I'm used to my songs getting a lot more, a lot more traction early on, so, like, I was—
Yeah, and I guess for the people that don't know, I mean… not that it's like garbage or anything, but AFTER IT ALL is, like, prolly one of your slowest moving projects, so it does mean something that, yeah, you know? This far in, even after all the… not necessarily clout but success you've had with, like, these songs, that melty's still kind of… a li'l behind
Yeah, I mean, it's doing well now, I-I haven't, like, listened to it or looked at it for a while, uhm-hm, probably because I had a lot of those songs on repeat while I was makin'—, nah, I feel you, same over here
But, um, yeah, so—, but I don't know, I liked how it came out, like, yeah, towards the end of it, it started off as like a, like a publicity play, but towards the end of it, I just kinda had fun, just dropped it, actually enjoyed it, right
Yeah, um, didn't really care what it did, it did kinda well, I think NO SLEEP! is almost at ten-K, the rest of the songs are all above four-K, uh, the two singles are well above twenty-K, like… now refresh my memory, was NO SLEEP! the one you were expecting to be, like, another… uh, oh, yes, yes pop-off single? Okay, for sure, alright, so that's—
That's why I put it as the first track, heheh okay, so that's cool, yeah, I'm glad that at least happened, you know? I see you, okay, and, well—, like, a lot of people loved it, it's actually my girlfriend—, one of my girlfriend's fav—, —made, oh, okay
But, um, I don't know, it just, just didn't do the numbers that I thought it would, I'm kinda disappointed, but, you know? A lot of people like it, like, everyone still sings it around, like, you know? A-Around these parts, 'cause I have a lot of, like, like, I have a big local following
That's, that's what a lot of people—, well, I don't even know if a lot of people don't know, but… um, that's what some people definitely aren't aware of: that you have a pretty like… I don't know about, like, decent local following, but you, you see the people… that like you, like, almost all the time I-R-L like… yeah
There are people in your immediate surroundings that aren't just like your girl or, like, your family or something that actually, like, come up to you and like ""Heya, that song of yours and—"", yeah, it's crazy 'cause, like, I'm, like, still like a legend in my high school, right
Like people still talk about me, people try to become rappers because, like, they know about me, yeah, people still listen to—, like, my girlfriend and, like, my friends who are still, like, lowerclassmen still, like, be like ""Yo, like, niggas still be bumping your shit""
And, like, the other day I went back to visit some teachers and, like, these kids saw me in the hallway and they just stared and looked at me, like, they knew who I was, right, I had no idea who they were, and I was like ""Wow"", it's like, you know? Like, down in—, down, down where my, where my school was, like the surrounding areas, like, you know? A lotta people knew me
When I used to work at the mall, that was closer to my school than, like, my old house, people would see me in the mall and they'd be like ""Oh shit"", they knew who I was, um, it's pretty cool, um, got invited to, like, a few parties and shit, okay, okay, that's cool
Not like it's, like, anything too crazy, but it was, like, it was enough to be like ""Okay, I'm, I'm, I'm getting somewhere"", yeah, no-no, and that's, that's important, um, when I was—, um… I was in Vegas recently, right? And, like, I talked to a couple people that, you know? Are pa—, I guess are part of the same community we're in, um, I mean
People like Shiki, and of course, like, I know Laye and… and some people off in the [?] even, um, and, like, we were talkin' about—, like, like of course us, especially you as a SoundCloud rapper, right? Like, we're, we're thriving off of these, um, Internet plays or whatever, we find it, like, less important to necessarily be, like, rocking with, like, the locals
But it's cool that you get to have both, you know? Um, because, I mean soon, who knows? You might have, like, a set somewhere for some… party or festival or whatever, you know? And, like, it wouldn't be unheard of 'cause there are people there who like you, you know? Yeah, I mean, a lot of people hate me though, heh, that's a whole different story
Like a lot of people just 'cause—, like, I kinda just came up, I was the kid in the back of, back of the lunchroom playin' Pokémon, uhm, shirt tucked in, nerdy ass jit, and then, like, around eleventh grade, twelfth grade, I became, like, the most popular kid in my school… 'cause everyone wanted to be my fuckin' friend, everybody wanted to hear me freestyle, true
You know? Um, everybody wanted to know what the fuck was good, and—, like, so, like, a lot of people hated me, um, 'cause they're like ""Oh, that's not the real you"", ""That's not this and that"", ""Like it's not that"", and I'm like ""Yo, it's not what it's about, like, I, like, I didn't switch up on nobody"", yeah
I'm still, I'm still playin' Pokémon… you still out here watchin' hentai, you feel me? Yeah, I—, still playin' Pokémon, it's just that I'm playing Pokémon with shofu now, so… yeah, it's different, I don't know, like, um, one of, one of my old bestfriends, he was—
Like, he came up to me one day and he's like ""Yeah, yeah, you really changed"", and—, —""What do you mean?"" Yeah, like, I just discovered—, if anything, I discovered who I really was… 'cause, like, this-this music shit… you know? And-And I say it a lot, it's like, you know? Without this music shit, I'd be dead, man, hm
This shit help me through a lot, uhm-hm, definitely kept me, it kept me out of doin' some dumb shit 'cause I definitely could be in the streets doin' some stupid shit, that's for sure, you know? I-I remember those times and, I mean, none of it's gonna be [?] here, heheh, but, I mean, yeah, you've definitely been through it, um
Even not too, like, long ago, right? I mean, it hasn't necessarily been super, like, smooth sailing for you, um, but that's what's cool, right? Like… people, at this point, both like you for, like, this insane, ignorant yelling, but, like, no—, as you can see, people still are showing up for, like, even your softer, like, melty stuff, um
'Cause, yeah, I mean, like, I like to make fun of you and say, like, you ain't got no talent or whatever which is fully true, heh, but, um, aw, it's—, like, you're still—, you're, you're doing—, you're definitely talented, like, you're putting out… these emotions in a way that, obviously, people can relate to, you know?
And sometimes, it's saying that… you know? Your mom… uh, eats sand at the beach or whatever, um, haha! But, you know? Sometimes, you're talking about… girl troubles or just… you know? Uh-huh, what, what you have in your mouth currently, what are you smoking, what are you—, like, you know? People relate, like it's—, this is life
Yeah, and, like, a lot of people—, and I get a lot from, like, the community quote, unquote, 'cause, I'm, I'm past that shit, you get what? Ev—, um, I feel like I get a lot of flak, uhm, because I'm not lyrical, right, I'm just, like, another ""Ignorant"" rapper, right
But to me—, and one of the most important things that I can do that a lot of these ""Lyrical"" rappers or other rappers can't do is that no matter what I say, if I deliver it in a certain way and bring a certain vibe to a song, yeah, I'm going to make you feel a certain emotion, yeah, yeah-yeah
I could talkin' about Hot Pockets, but if I croon that shit over some smooth auto-tune, yeah, bet your bitchass is gonna be cryin', yeah, tal—, thinkin' 'bout your ex, yeah, [?] Hot Pockets, yeah, no-no, that-that's… and, like—, and that's talent as much as it hurts them to hear it, right?
Yeah, a lot of people don't like it, a lot of people who were there since I started think that, like, I fell into a box or I did this and did that, like, I'll still drop a sixteen on your bitchass, while, great, I mean that's, that's, while I auto-tune, yeah, crazy, that's, that's what's crazy, right?
Like, you… like—, alright, like, I'm obviously not, like, the pinnacle of, like, lyricism or anything, but, like, you prolly have that over plenty people, including myself, because you were freestylin', like, on the daily, um, yeah, and that's something that even most of these ""Lyrical, spiritual"" rappers can't do right now, so—
Haha, I mean—, and, like, a lot of my songs are freest—, I don't know, it's just practice, yeah, like, uh, some nights, I'll mak—, like, I have, like, I wanna say, like, not to, like, exaggerate, and I'm really not, I prolly have like thirty songs… that will never come out, yeah, 'cause you're just freestyli—
That, like, I-I just make them, like, when I'm bored at night just to, like, keep—, you know? It's-It's-It's-It's almost like workin' out, you know? Yeah, you constantly wanna work out… to build your muscle mass, like, you know? I'm constantly freestyling, constantly making music, you know? Just so I can stay as sharp as possible
So, I-I did run—, I was on this point about, like, you know? Like, before, you were definitely—, you had gone through some stuff and, also, like, you said, like, you know? You were super nerdy back then, um, you know?
Some of that's still intact, but, at what point—, 'cause I-I have a guess, but at what point in your—, in, like, I guess your career, if you wanna say, like—, do you—, would you say this started, like, changing? 'Cause, like, I still remember you, like, necessarily, you know? We-Well, at the beginning, like, definitely not being noticed, but, you know? Out here trying…
On your Instagram and Facebook and putting stuff up and, like, like, for God sake, you… had a song with, like, Stayble, like, organically, ya know? Hahaha, like it was, it was just, like, what it was, you—, it wasn't for clout, it wasn't for his clout, it was just ""Yeah, this is regular for me, PE$O PETE"", like, wh-when would you say that that started changing?
RYUKO MATOI, huh? Okay, um, that was my first real, like, trap song, um, first real song that I actually, like, put thought into structure for, like, I was like ""Okay, hook, bridge"", right, ""Verse"", um, felt, like, a lot more professional, um, obviously, one of my more turnt songs of that time period, right
But, um, I-I think that was, like, the beginning, maybe it was, like, rising action, and then, like, the-the climax… would probably be around TROUBLE IN PARADISE 1, um… yeah, that's what I was gonna say as my guess: that, um, I think… the first TIP really, um, hahaha, God, cemented it, hah, um…
Yeah, a-a lot went down with, with that first one, um, there are songs on there that are still, like, looking competitive numbers-wise, BANG!, yeah, I mean, like—, and that's a song that, that the other day, I was like ""Oh right, I have this in my likes, like… let me listen to it again"" and, like, it still strikes me the same way
Like, at-at this point, like, if, like, the community manages to get several people that, you know? Get clouted up, this is definitely gonna be, like, a community classic, you know? Yeah, its greatest hits, for sure, I like the, uh, I like the idea of making songs and, like, them being, like timeless, like, MIAMI VICE is definitely another one of tho—
Yeah, um… one of—, I think my favorite off of, I guess, TIP 2, I hate that song, haha, I heard that shit way too many times, really? Yeah, okay, well, just because of that, alright, um… is there something you don't like about it actually?
Goin' back to it, yeah, it's, like, it's just fully—, it's, like, the—, fully freestyled, okay, it's just loud, uh, I-I lose flows at some points 'cause my voice is just dying, I don't know—, I think you definitely start, like, losin' the freestyle I think the second verse or something, like, there's something—
Oh, most definitely, yeah, but at that point, no one gives a shit, you're already hype, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, ha, um, I was kinda upset that that was the song that KILLINGSPREE decided to first repost and first interact with me—, —definitely rapped on his beats before, ummmmm, fuck that nigga… but, bu—, nah, I'm jokin', I love, I love that nigga
He's kind of a—, kinda weirdo, but proceed, I mean that—, okay, huh? What-What did—, what song did you expect him to repost first? [?], from something from that project or—, eh, I mean, any of the songs that I rapped on his beats, I don't know, it was, oh, it was just strange to me that, like, he wouldn't… peep the songs that I rapped on his beats with
But I guess MIAMI VICE just—, you know? And MIAMI VICE was crazy, even, like, Anonymuz saw that, oh right, right, um, you know? A lot of people really liked that song and then I, I followed it up in what I can think is gonna be the—, is, as of right now, the most… craziest back-to-back moment of my entire career was when I went MIAMI VICE and then ON ICE!
Oh yeah, that's true, you know? I haven't even put that together, yeah, you went from, like—, that almost would have seemed… premeditated like… huh? Yeah, like—, I'm not smart enough to do that, heh, yeah, I-I-I know, I know, ha, like, and-and-and not that it's a smart thing, but, like
You-You definitely move, um, you know? Very, uh—, like, you're just ""Do what's on your heart"", I guess, right? But, uh… eh, yeah, but, um… heh, to put it nicely, yeah, or ignorantly, um… yeah, but, yeah, that's crazy, 'cause that-that-that song popped off, too, um…
Do—, I mean, I-I'm sure you're—, are-are you proud of TIP 1 and 2? TIP 3 is gonna be crazy… it's crazy, you think—, it's crazy already, you think it's not even gonna compare? Like it's already on its own league? I—, at the way I'm workin' on it, yeah, mm, I already scrapped, like, four songs, alright
I'm havin', is—, I'm havin' Lewi go overtime, heh, alright, 'cause, like, I go back—, are you a scrapper? Do you scrap a lot of songs? No, I don't, okay, I usually don't just gi—, I usually don't give a fuck and I just post everything, that's interesting
Half of TIP 2, half of TIP 2 had parts in it where it was, like, ""Shit, I needed to, like, redo that"" and I just don't, I just didn't give a fuck, I just posted it, mm, but, like, TIP 2 is full of a lot of classics, we got LEGEND!, ON ICE!, MIAMI VICE, um, like, a lot of those songs really, like, resonated very well with my fans
And they're still classics to this day in, like, a lot of people's hearts, yeah, and I feel like it definitely did better than TIP 1… which is what I was tryna do, right-right, that's, a given, yeah, and then, like—, so, like, I'm moving very, very carefully with TIP 3, um, Lewi will send me a, like, a beat pack and I'll-I'll be very selective, you know?
Usually, mm,I just rap on whatever he sends me, but, like, I'm bein' very selective this time arou—, okay, um, I don't force songs, I-I, like—, back in the day, if I, like, couldn't write something to it, I just freestyled to it, bullshit, and put it out, but, like, you know? I'm not forcing songs (*Unintelligible Conversation*)
If I don't feel the beat at the moment, I'll let it sit for a while, you know? That's wise, yeah, no, it—, it's different, I don't know, *Coughing*, what, what do you think has [?] in this position? 'Cause, I mean, is it just, like, clout alone or is it, like, I guess, being around, like, shofu now? Like, the pressure's different (*Unintelligible Conversation*)
Well, one of the people, and I know a lotta niggas who hear this shit are gonna love him, 'cause I know everybody loves this nigga, alright, but, um, one of the people to really open my eyes is Matt Houston, you know, everybody's favorite, shout-out to him, um, that's my nigga, Matt Houston, LMTLESS ga—, I am part of LMTLESS, by the way
LMTLESS gang… so—, in this bitch, tha-that was gonna be a question for later, but, I—, is-is that, just, like, official? I don't remember seeing anything about that, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, he, yeah, he-he… fuckin' texted my phone, he's like ""Yo, LMTLESS?"", and I'm like ""Let's go"", okay, um, and you were say—
Matt has—, he's harsh, he's kind of a asshole sometimes, right, but, um, he has a certain take on music and a certain take on the writing process… right, that I think it was very important for me to hear, 'cause I kinda was getting too lost in the sauce, mm, with my freestyle shit, yeah-yeah
And Matt kinda… reinvigorated… my pen, so, like—, you know? Had a few woke-ass talks with him… and a few woke-ass talks with shofu, too, and, you know? I realized that I'm in a different league now, it's… it's on some different shit, you know? Right (*Unintelligible Conversation*)
And, like, yeah, my fans'll eat up what I post, yeah, people like the ignorant shit, but, like, I can make 'em better shit, I can make 'em better things, I could be doin' ignorant shit better if I write shit and plan shit, yeah-yeah, no, that's true, and, um… you know?
Yeah, I'm just, like, I-I have—, whether I like it or not, I have to be on a different wavelength, 'cause, like, I… I can't… stop moving with my clout, like-like, as I get more noticed, I have to keep leveling up, I can't stay on the, on the same floor, you know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, you can't stand pretty, I know
So that requires some reinvention, so I think TRIP—, and [?], TIP 3 might be a little different than TIP 2, um… but for better, but fo—, oh, definitely for better, I been playin' some, some snippets here and there, right, niggas' really fuckin' wit' that, um, prolly 'cause of different flows, prolly 'cause I'm… writing full verses… heh, again, um
Tryin' out new things, you know? I-I got the auto-tune down pat, I got the screaming down pat, right, try-tryna find, like, a good middle ground and combining the both of them to make a really, like, dynamic song, um, so then—, it's almost like some sort of theoretical science, you know? Like, ha, I'm just tryna find—, okay, it's-it's—, dude, it gets deep, man
Tryna find, like—, ""Okay, if I scream this part of the hook and emphasize that, and then, for the bridge, I just ditch all ignorant shit and croon some woke shit, but then I come back for the verse and just write, and then just come in with heavy bars"", mmmmm, it was findin' out what aspect—, it's like, you know? I'm buildin' a Frankenstein here, you know?
I'm, I'm tryna figure out which parts of each song… right-right, no, that makes sense, you know? Can make, can make this masterpiece and not some lumbering monster that just goes ""Arrrrr!"", no, so… that's funny, yeah, 'cause, um, I guess on, on my side of the thing is, like, I-I definitely have this thing always in my head of, like… (*Unintelligible Conversation*)
Like if I'm rapping a verse, I rarely like to, maybe like, keep the same flow for all sixteen bars, um, so it is interesting to see that you are also, like, experimenting, like, with the switching it up here and even finding a, like, a third strong suit, um, I think it's also cool that, I mean, that, uh, you know? Houston's… getting you to do that, I guess, um
'Cause, yeah, I mean… even the people in the community that necessarily aren't, like-like, hating on you have told you like, you know? ""Your stuff's good, but maybe don't freestyle everything"", um, so—, y'all need to shut the fuck up, I got more clout than all of you, hah, welp, hahaha, case closed! That's me being—, that's just me being ignorant
Nah, I actually wanted to take a second to shout-out some of the people in that community that I still… really appreciate, 'cause, like, I really wouldn't have got to my spot without a few of you, right-right, and that's, like, that's JaqKel, you know? Everybody in my, in my circle, you know? It's, like, bster, x, Lewi, oddwin, breh, um, yourself, uhm-hm, um, Azstro
But, like, you know? Really important shouts out to, like, Jurel, Ish1da, ummmmm, AGenius, he has heard me since I've had—, uh, you gotta ask him about that shit, I used to—, I remember one of the first songs I ever made was an open collab' he did and I recorded that shit on my laptop microphone, oh my god, no way
Yeah, and, like, it's funny now 'cause you—, if you go back to that, and, like, I ask him about it and I'm like ""Look at me now, bitch!"" Yeah, it's crazy, man, I have—, you know? So definitely shout-out to him, he needs to drop that song we made already, you stu—, I'm watchin' you, nigga, you fuckin' [?], believe me, I-I'm on his ass, you finna need a [?]
'Cause, like, I, uh, heh, heh, I made the cover art for, like, whatever project that's supposed to be on it and it's like ""Alright, when am I gonna see it?"" and, yeah, man's crazy, I haven't heard the finished song, I haven't even heard it, well, and—, ugh, that's good, 'cause it keeps you, you know? Steady, I guess, heh, I mean, hahahaha
And speaking of AGenius, um, Diggz, right, he's everybody's grandpa, mm, um, hah, that nigga's live, um… MangaD, you know? Yes, yeah, [?] MangaD, I'm tryna think, I feel like there's someone else on the tip of my tongue, RealVenom, very important, very important, I started—, dude, yeah, an—, you-you actually had, like, a lot of interactions with him in the beginning
And then speaking of where I started, shout-out Kawaii Gang, [?] forwar—, yeah, okay, wait-wait-wait, so, actually, um, I wa—, eh, I was reminiscing about that, so, like, RealVenom, y'all had the BLVCK OPAL thing goin' on for a bit? Yeah, we were, we were in a collab' group for a while, but… sadly, that's just not the type of music that I wanted to make no—
Right, no, and, like, you know? Like, you know? To-To each their own and it's both of y'all rights to, you know? As artists, yeah, you must do what you—, the music you wanna do, um, but also, Kawaii Gang, right? I mean, like, I-I, I for—, I forgot that you were shouting out KG on stuff, like, a while ago, like—, um, so I'm assuming shout-out to Timi, right?
Timi O, Tony Choppa, right, GMakin, Kels, [?], right, fuckin' bitchass nigga, but, um, nah, Tony Choppa and Timi O are, uh, two, two of the people in—, just like in AGenius' shoes, I recorded one of my first songs for them—for one of Tony's open collabs—on my niece's Samsung tablet microphone, yeah, I-I did—
And whenever I FaceTime Tony, 'cause, you know? Me and him are actually pretty close, okay, that's one of the things we always reminisce about, it's like ""Damn, bro', I came from, like, fifty followers… trappin' off a Samsung tablet microphone…"", heh, ""On some stupid shit to, like, now, like, here I am""
Like, right, it's—, I-I'll never forget the days where I'd go into my stepsister's closet with the tablet, heh, and, like, I downloaded some bootleg recording app', or, like, I'd use the Samsung voice memo app' and then e-mail the voice memo to her computer and then use Audacity to mix that shit, heh, oh wow, [?] shit, shit was a struggle back then, bro', yeah-yeah, no, that's—
Aye, but that's how you know you really wanted it, I guess, even if it was effing around, like—, yeah, okay, but, um—, and speaking of beginnings, I just wanna touch on this, I don't really wanna talk about it too much 'cau—, —can't give free clout to the unworthy, okay, but, also wanna give a… empty shout-out to Rex, em—, yeah, more of like a—, just a mention, not even honorable
Yeah, it's more of like a—, it's more of like a nod, okay, definitely one of the first people I interacted with, uh, heavy, um, we disconnected because—, and what a lot of people don't realize is that… this rap shit is a business, this music shit is a business, I see, and if you, and if you don't do anything to ta—, to take it beyond business… um, you know?
Like, oddwin, x, Lewi, like, yeah, I work with them a lot, but they're also my—, you guys are also my friends, you know? Like, yeah, it's-it's past the-the fourth wall, like, we're not—, it's not just music no more, you guys past that, like, we're-we're homeboys, like, uhm-hm, you know? And, like, that's what keeps people around… to me because business is business
I do my business with you and I'm gone, and that nigga did nothing but keep it business, all he wanted was, you know? To give and then, and then expect back, like, as homeboys, oddwin can repost my shit, he's not gonna ask me for a repost back, right-right, I see—, or, like, JaqKe—, like, JaqKel can repost my shit, I won't—, like, you know? He might ask for a repost back
But if I fuck wit' one of his songs heavy, he'll know 'cause I'll repost that shit, you know? I'm not wit' that whole, like, ""Oh, if you support me or, like, I gotta support you back"", that's—, it—, there's a difference between being my friend and, like, a business partner, and then being just a fan, ummmmm, you know what I'm sayin'? Yeah
So—, just wanted to touch on that real quick, but, yeah, yeah, [?] type [?], I meant—, well, well, we'll keep it moving, um… but, uh, I mean, I guess, my two cents: I-I don't necessarily personally have something against the guy, I mean, I'm-I'm neutral to him, you know? He's, he's definitely… putting out music, but it is unfortunate, in general, I'll say, um…
To—, when, when stuff like that is miscommunicated, um, and that's something we see a lot in the community, I guess, like, all this drama and whatnot, you know? Quote unquote ""Beef"", um, seriously, it's honestly just 'cause—, like, there-there's some sort of misunderstanding, like, it's never that serious over here, you know? Um, but I mean, y-you're in greener pastures now
Like you-you get the luxury of not necessarily havin' to care, um, yeah, I, I decided to distance myself from that shit, yeah, 'cause, even though I met a lot of cool people and, like, I still talk to a lot of these people, I think the community itself is a gimmick, uhm, I think that… it's a bunch of… hands behind peoples' backs, you know? Uhm
And a lotta, like, how do I say this? It's like a lotta, like, hidden meanings, you know? A lot of people want—, it's like, it's… it's not real c—, like, camaraderie, so to speak, right, you know? People just want what they want from other people and that's really it, and, like, it's true, it's a, it's a bad environment to grow in
I'll never, I'll never disrespect to the fullest 'cause that's where I started, right, but… that's a box that I refuse to keep myself—, and, like, even though—, hella—, I know, like—, I met hella people, like, that's like my family, like, you know? Mm, so many people that I've met that have got me through life and that have, and that have, you know? Taken me to where I am now
Or from that community, but… it's like high school, like, you know? Very much, if you don't kn—, if you don't have… you know? The grit or the talent or the motivation to put yourself out of that box and then grow on your own… you'll just be stuck in that same shit for the rest of your damn life, nah, you're right, and I had, had to make an executive decision, ya know?
I sti—, I-I still kept in contact with everyone that I needed to… mm, and everyone that wanted to, and, you know? I still try to give my two cents in here and there, but… when do you think this decision went full force? Um, 'cause-'cause if-if, if I were to, I guess, erroneously guess, I know—, I can see you being, uh, most in touch with, like, that project, um… your MIRAMAR joint, right?
But I don't know, like, was it progressive or was there, like, an album, or project, whatever, that you were like ""No, really, like, I'm, I'm literally not doing it for a community, like, it's just Lewi and I or I'm just—"", you know? Like, what like—, um, TROUBLE IN PARADISE 2, okay, was definitely, like, the full set-in of that, me and Lewi sat down like usual, we have, like, late night conversations
Talk business, talk people, mm, you know? That's my right-hand man, gotta keep him close, right, you dig? So, like, um… and we both agreed, you know? The community's not offering us anything that we haven't already obtained, already, we've passed everybody else, mm, um, not totally number-wise, but, like—, came from nothing, man, and I became one of the golden childs, you know?
One of the golden children of the community, you know? Yeah, no, um—, everybody still root—, e-e-everybody still rootin' for me, everybody still rootin' for us, but, like, I feel like we have bigger things to chase right now, we've-we've-we've done what, ah, we've done what we could at that stage and we just kinda need to find our next pasture… to thrive in, yeah, no, for sure, um
I think, like, you were saying, you're very much the people—, the person that people root for and then away, like, I mean… I know people have had groups and artists have been big before within the community, but you, you might be on track to be, prolly like, the closest to, like, the biggest face for the community, you know?
'Cause, like, I mean, I might be mad ignorant right now, but, like, no really comes to mind that, like, is really this—, in-in, like, this mu—, many Venn diagrams of, like, demographics, you know? Like, soon… like, if we start projecting PETE now, like, with your ties to shofu and even if you start making, like, some of, like, some of your own stuff, you may very well be involved in this community thing
Um, and of course I know it's cringe, but whatever, like, the-the, the otaku, like, nerd stuff, like, 'cause you might mention it here and there… yeah, and then also, like, with the shofu stuff, like, the Pokémon scene, but that might branch into even just, like, gaming and, like, the YouTube scene which is different, um, like, even, like, the Smash scene which comes with its own thing, like—
And, like SoundCloud rap is a thing and, like, you're in Florida, you know? Heheh, like—, I got a lot of shit lined up for me, so, like—, heh, yeah, I ha—, I definitely—, I'm definitely on some pay-to-win shit right now, that's for sure, yeah-yeah, um
So… I guess so we don't keep goin' on forever, I mean… I know you and I—, how long you tryna—, you said what? How long you tryna make this? Haha, no-no, I-I'm gonna wrap it up, that's, that's why I say that, I mean, 'cause I know you and I could talk forever, but I mean, oh for sure, for the sake of… the upload, um…
Yeah, I don't know how many SoundCloud minutes you got, boy, ha, nah, I-I pay, haha, I got money unlike some canvases over here, um, don't choke on your vape, um, aha, I almost did, ha, oh fuck, ahahaha, what is… I guess one to two, like—, your biggest, your biggest goal with TIP 3? Like, what is what you really wanna get out of it the most? 'Cause I know it's on the way
I wanna see—, I want, I want this to be the defining moment for me and Isaiah, um, droppin' government names 'cause it's serious now, mm, um, I want this to be the defining moment for the both of us and I wanna see us not to struggle anymo—, 'cause it's very hard for both of us, yeah, you know? With Lewi's laptop and then you—
If it's not me eating, yeah, eating air for dinner, then it's, it's Lewi hitting my line saying ""Yo, PE$O, can you PayPal me a few bucks? Like, I can't Uber home, like, I can't make it home from work"", like, shit is tough, and, like, one of the main reasons why TIP 3 hasn't been worked on as much, because of that, yeah, is because… um, Lewi couldn't afford Internet for a while
He didn't have Internet in his crib, uhm, so, like, even if he was making beats for me, there was no way that I'd be able to receive them, yeah, so, you know? Financial obligations and, like, the overall struggle of just life for both of us really put a hold on that shit
Like, I-I-I get that I kinda talked way too much shit about it coming out sooner than it was supposed to be, uhm-hm, but, um…, 'cause it prolly felt like it was soon, a—, you just don't know, yeah, you can't plan for these things
But then all that shit happened, Lewi's computer broke, God bless shofu for helping us, um, he definitely topped off the donation pool that wa—, that we, that we were—, —to get Lewi a new P-C, right, and, you know? Get him back and running, but, like, all that shit started happening, I had to transition into college which I'm transitioning out of already, haha
Um, because I have other plans with life, [?], but, um, yeah, you feel me? But, um, yeah, I want this to be the defining moment for the both of us: to open the door for us, no oddwin, and, um, ha, and really get us, really get us, like—, the foot in the door like, ""We're here"", like, I see, ""What's up, Trippie Redd?"", like-like, you know? Okay, ""What's up, Pump?""
Like, ""We're here"", like, ""We been here, look at us, it's time, it's—, we're-we're 'boutta fuck shit up"", right, like, you know? And, like, I definitely feel like if I sit back and I focus, and Lewi sits back and he focuses, we can make that happen, 'cause TIP 2 did amazing, right, I would have never thought that would get numbers like that… holistically for a whole mixtape ever, TIP 2 did amazing
Yeah, yeah, lot of it was fuckin' around, and if it TIP 2 was fuckin' around, Lord knows that if we sit back and we really plan shit for TIP 3, it can be, oh, excuse me, I almost died, it can be a masterpiece, and, you know? [?], I-I-I—, yeah, that's-that's the craziest thing: that I think it's so plausible, if you look at the—, all of the TIPs, um, exponentially, hahaha, pause! Haha
Like, you know? You're going from, like, your ten-K's to your forty-K's to—, I mean, dude, like, I—, it's not unheard of, like, you might be hitting your hundred-K's soon, you know? Yeah, and not that that's the ceiling, but… I mean, if you really wanna factor it in, the LIKE RED remix on shofu's YouTube cha—, —um, that's the first song I've ever been on that's hit a hundred-K, true, that's true
Um, a song that I'm on has starred on iTunes, we're-we're-we're hitting hu—, three—, like, three-hundred-thousand plus on Spotify streams for Trap Ketchum, like, that's what's up, you know? And a lot of my songs are the top-played ones, you know? It's like… it's just more and more opportunities and more and more reasons to keep pushing out what I'm trying to do, okay
And, um, I, yeah, I guess it helps I got a lot of people with clout on my side, but, like, we—, I-I don't see it like that, like, that's just my team, we're stacked, and we're ready to fuck shit up, heheh, like, um, yeah, that's great, got a lot of shit on the way, man, and, like, I been really practicing, honing my craft
'Cause I really feel like if we make the right moves at the right time, uhm-hm, 2018 will be the year, nah, man, I mean, I-I see you're workin' here, it goes down in the servers all the time, um, you're, you're close to your fans and you're even closer with, you know?

[Hook: Ludacris]
You just came home from doin a bid
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor!
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around me!
Ya peeps talkin 'bout ""What kinda shits he on?""
You disappear like ""Poof, bitch be gone!""
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break!
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?!

Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday, so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And for the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'Cause my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun
[Hook: Ludacris]
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them girls up the block still runnin they mouth
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off-ramp, doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with a barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic
So girls, hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and tear the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens!
[Hook: Ludacris]
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and stems!
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If the bottle's all gone and your eyes are red
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

You ready Mase?
Party people in the place to be (Uh-huh)
It's about that time for us to (Yeah)
*Screams*

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck
Piece all glittered up, stick up kid, nigga what?
Jig with a cut, sip Cris, spit it up
Ho's ride, get your nut 'till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I done hit everything from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall, hand on your balls?
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club?
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my fresh clothes
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those extra O's
Buy the E, get a key to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions the only thing we in a hurry to make
Whether friend or ex-friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
You can't understand, we be Waikiki
Sippin' DP 'til the TV look 3D
Little kids see me way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome BB's, they wanna be me
Niggas talkin' shit, they ought to quit
Unfortunate, they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just started seeing cars 'cause they auctioned it
So while you daydream, my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with hoes that pose in Maybelline
One time you had it all, I ain't mad at y'all
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy ball
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars, nigga
It's like y'all be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money

Do Puff drive Mercedes? (Yeah, yeah)
Take hits from the '80s? (Yeah, yeah)
But do it sound so crazy? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Well me personally, it's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE, smoke my Nestle
No mad rap-ASCAP, where my check be?
Problem with y'all I say it directly
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to ménage in suites
Now I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls that used to hardly speak
[Chorus: Kelly Price & Ma$e]
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (Yeah)
You make me feel so good (Uh-uh)
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good

Yo Iz, let's do this
[Verse 1: Ice-T]
I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalkin'
Livin' life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse
Vendettas of death back; the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Sucka dive for your life when my shotgun scatters
The gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply

[Interlude: Ice-T]
You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us, man
It's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'
People don't even understand
They don't even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work
But people don't understand the size of this
This is no joke man, this is real

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honor, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got?
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity, live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they're understandin' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my set, guess my religion
You might also like[Interlude: Ice-T]
Yo my brother was a gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
I don't know why I do it man, I just do it
I never had much of nothing man
Look at you man, you've got everything going for yourself
And I ain't got nothing man, I've got nothing
I'm living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man, look at me

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
My pants are saggin', braided hair
Suckas stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my set, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homicide's my favorite binge

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang
You don't wanna be in it man
You're just gonna end up in a mix of dead friends and time in jail
I know, if I had a chance like you
I would never be in a gang man
But I didn't have a chance
You know I wish I did
[Verse 4: Ice-T]
I'll just walk like a giant, police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gang's my family, it's all that I have
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph
You don't like it, so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Psycho-analyze tried diagnosin' me, why?
It wasn't your brother that brutally died
But it was mine, so let me define
My territory; don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy cause that shit don't faze me
If you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me
Cause my colors death
Though we all want peace
But our war won't end
'Till all wars cease

[Interlude: Ice-T]
See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me, man
But I don't wanna be down with this situation man
But I'm in here, if I had something better to do I think I'd do it But right now, I'm just down here boy
I'm trying to get money cause I'm smart
I'm gonna get paid while I'm out here
I'm gonna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying
If I had a chance like you
Maybe I would be in school
But I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving
And I'm willing to die for my colors
[Outro]
Yo, please stop cause I want y'all to live

Check it out now...
I work the pen to make the ink transform
On any particular surface the pen lands on
Zaakir is hands on, what's the beef?
The Cooley High Cochise high post techniques
I drape off poetic landscapes and shapes
Illustrate the paper space off the pens that paint
Then design what have a National Geographic a magic
With tailor-made status and plus flavor that's automatic

[Chorus: All Jurassic 5]
We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden

[Verse 2: Marc 7even]
Melancholy mundane so I tame the hot flame
Big rings, fat chains, and y'all quest for the same
No name, use fame, strictly new to the thang
We stay true to the game and never bring it to shame
We tight like dreadlocks or Redd Foxx and ripple
We pass participles, and smash the artist in you
The saga continues, this I won't get into
Cause there ain't enough bars to hold the drama that we been through

We entertain for a mutual game from close range
Steady aim, I drum at your head to hit the brain

Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?
Don't that shit there make you mad? They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh (Ha ha) put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Gon' and put your hands up, when times is hard, you stand up

Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy

No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home

[Verse 1: Common]
Let go and let me live inside you
What your mouth don't say baby your thighs do
I want us to arrive together
I love it when the weather
Is wet and sticky, some depict me
As being conscious, yeah I use my head
It was you that fed, my appetite for seduction
Biting and cussing, making love and uh
Touching where no one has ever touched before
The heat, got you open like an oven door
Because of your innocence
Even more you'll remember this hardcore gentleness
Before you wasn't into this
On the ride, your freak became limitless
Holding on to the night and me tight
As we write on the walls a story called ""Go!""

You do it like you believe it
Able to give and receive it with openness
Emotions just spill
I'm giving you something that you can feel
It's hard to stay still
Rubbing your desires up against mine
I feel you shakin, I'm thinkin that next time
My fingers on the hook of your neck
Deep in your eyes is a look of respect
Soft wet brown sugar, mixed with cinnamon
Said you learning to trust men again
If this is love, made our self
Is made for you to feel empowered at the same time helpless
You dealt with a lot and your screams and moans
Something bout you go off that I see I'm home
For we don't have to think no more
It's synchronicity and raw
And this is what I came here for

Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling ""Fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling ""Fuck me""
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

Back back, way back, I used to fret that my honey
Would play me for one with more papes, still it was funny
Cause she paid no mind as jerks lurked constantly
And my insecurity turned into maturity (I matured)
As the years pass, I find it hard to be monogamous
So do other brothers, so the scene's still synonymous
Catch crazy glares when I'm with female company
Some think I'm a softie and they step to her in front of me
So in public places I am often found in my trunk
Reaching for bats, and smack goes his spunk
Because I have the right to riff, and in spite
Of a few protests, progress and I might smite you
Once you're caught, your fronts, they got no future
Blunts blur my sight, get left and right suture
I know this, and also notice advances:
I peeped them papers slickly slipped to My dip
With numerals, and you're soon to roast thinking I'm jelly
'Cause numbers left in the gutter lead to lonely tellies (Telephones)
(God damn, why won't she call?)
'Cause we see who's pee-wee and we see who's me
The difference is Vaseline: You're slipping while I'm skin-dipping
Grips and grips of chumps my way:
Slumped from back-bumps on rumps, 'cause I flay
So why play, cause Tajai has to flip
I found mine, so find your own companionship

Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl
But ask yourself, homeboy, why is that? (Yo)

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
Brothers get jealous when I'm chilling with my dip
Just because she's flyer, you try to, play me like Milton Bradley
I'm mad, G, just because you've gotta settle for Maggie
Or Agnes, maybe Mathilda the Witch, yo
I'mma have to beat you if you call her a bitch, yo
Keep your mind off what's mine for the keeping (Yup)
Or I'll put a bomb in your house while you're sleeping (Boom!)
Keep your distance, Hiero is watching you
Step by step, I never slept, I gots to do lots
'Cause you brothers never respect who you should (Me)
Try to be my friend, and it might do you good (Yeah)
Get down with the program, hey yo man yo
Don't even look at my girl on a slow jam
Of course not, you'll never get that close (Nah)
To her soft skin, rest in a coffin
If you ever disrespect, I'll twist your neck
If I've got a bat, I might get pissed and flex (Boom)
'Cause your tramp ain't got a stamp of approval
When I get mine with this rhyme, your crew will
Have to learn the hard way
I'll have to slam you like Hammer, so I bet you'll all break
Even though his song is wack, mine's not
Your girl will never get the props that mine got
[Chorus]
Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself, homeboy, why is that?

[Verse 3: Opio]
I'm the brother stepping with the flyer female companion
Others be scheming or scamming, dreaming, planning, plotting
Trying to make moves when I'm not in the vicinity
I'll fill that ass with splinters, see
Pull a wood bat, would that change your disposition?
Wishing you was in my position, kissing and hugging on a goddess
But I stay humble and modest
Brothers want to rumble, but they stumble and fumble
'Cause they get pummelled by the mischievous
You might catch a whiff of this sneaker
Seek the company of my sweet senorita?
Swing a bat like The Natural, break your clavicle
Fracture femurs, as you scream, I'm overcome with laughter
I'm the champion, my man slaps me ten 'cause she's twice as nice Twice the jealousy 'cause fellas see they don't suffice
Opio Lindsey spins the spinal cords
Of the hordes of the Huckleberry Finns
My knuckles are buried in chins 'cause it offends when you're stepping
Adrenalin is pumping, I thump chumps with my weapon
Moments of tranquility abruptly have to cease
Walking hand in hand, when one feels he has to speak his peace
Should I pull a piece and unleash a couple of bullets?
Would it persuade a brother to turn his head and foot it
In the opposite direction, throat sets in his chin
Recognized that I fooled him
[Chorus]
Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy, why is that?
Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl
Everytime she sees you
She could just take off
And you could just let off steam by screaming

I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, then the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed, hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey, nigga, roll that weed up (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A., they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now shawty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)

You that faggot-ass nigga tryna pull me back, right?
When my joint get to bumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, ""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in L.A., every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass and symbolize sex
And hot Atlanta, y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York, women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feeling myself too much, I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know

Can I please, say my piece?
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased

Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried
Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta, better believe it
Shanice, you're my piece from Compton, before I'm off the plane
Make sure you cop some trees to spark up
Danielle, ATL, got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you sent it with Chanel
You looking good in that one showing off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cartis
Take me to afterparties, her name was Khari
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch, I'm sorry
But, hey Kim, how's Minneapolis?
You so pretty, hate you show off your titties for silly classes

[Intro]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
La, la
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse]
Walkin' with my back to the sun, keep my head to the sky
Me against the world, it's me, myself and I, like De La
Got in touch with my soul
Treadin' softly on the path down the rockiest road
Life isn't ice cream without Monopoly dough
The property grows in value, and rightfully so, I gotta have it
I see the way the people get treated, it's problematic
They ready to set us up for failure, it's systematic
But when I felt it, my eyes melted
The selfish are constantly profitin' off thе helpless
I'll nevеr do my team green, make the team green like the Celtics
The ones that ain't makin' it overzealous, they show and tell us
Throughout history, earnin' cheddar
They form and break out nickel-plated chrome Berettas
The same ol' story in a whole different era
I'm watchin' massacres turn to runnin' mascara, but anywho
For the pain, see what this Henny do
So we can see what lies beneath as we pour up a swig of truth
The sun sets as I sip a few
The sky turns a different hue farther from the color blue
The nighttime has arrived, I recline for the evenin'
I'm hawkin' down the next goal, the name's ain't Stephen
I started in a nightmare so pinch me, I'm dreamin'
I'm killin' off my demons 'cause my soul's worth redeemin'

Roll me a blunt so I forget it
But it make the details look so vivid (So vivid)

And all I hear is jealousy, I call them niggas jelly beans
Love my trigger finger so much, I bought it a wedding ring, yeah
Yeah, let's get married
Cut off his head and the rest get buried
Cross on my head like a Presbyterian
Tell him he dead and upset his parents
Tears get shed only if you carin'
Right on his head, see the red beam blarin'
Two twelve gauges like twenty four karats, hol' up
Ain't that a bitch? I might bang at your bitch
If I go at her neck, I might hang that lil' bitch
Scope on the TEC and it came with that shit
I could hit you up from any range with that bitch
Got papers on Draco, a case in Laredo
You fuck with me wrong, I'ma bake your potato
I twist his head up just like a tornado
Pull out the toast, I'm like, ""Leggo my Eggo""
I buss down a Quaalude, fuck on a gay ho
Can't find a straight a ho, but I ain't complainin'
That's how my day go, I said, ""Okay, ho""

I grab the Henny and twist the top
Guzzle it that's when the reaction starts
I split the chalk with the dutch
Had the hash in the greenery, then the L get sparked
Keith Murray's never smokin' on babbith
Niggas give me dirt and I throw it in the garbage
Actual facts, writin exact, sacks of African Black
I smoke two back to back
I smoke so much I choke out fire alarms
With the towel under the door feel the effect of the bar
Put Visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Looked in the mirror, said to myself yo you high as hell
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
Inahle it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound*, blow it out yo nose

[Chorus]
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM

Me and the Funk Doctor Spot up top on the hop
Block two big jig hot shots coppin mots
Seasons slice precise, ice 'n' tights
Chickenheads that circle the block twice
If you chokin then pass cuz it's not a game
Bitches hit my blunts and never feel the same
They start actin strange and kinda erotic
I try to tell her you ain't nothin bout no chronic
Ahh drats I think I'll take a long walk
And light a fat one up for the sergeant general of New York
Who determine gettin lifted kill brain cells maybe
If it wasn't for weed, niggas would be goin crazy
So smell it from afar, comin from the bar
Or rushin out when I open up the car door
Whether home or party in a bag or a jar
Put that lah in the air and represent what is stand for

[Chorus]
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""

(Phase 3)

I'm not sayin I'ma a pothead, cuz I'm not
I'm just sayin that I smoke alot
Catch me in V.I.P. smokin with Dennis Scott
Or after the show in the parkin lot
I only buy weed from a selective few
Cuz niggas is wicked and they will get you
I ran outta blunts got some paper from your mother
She had extra weed so we rolled another
No doubt, I hear you out
Before I roll my L, I think the cancer part out
I'm uptight cuz I missed the buddah stop before the flight
And damn we gon be away for like 12 nights
So here I am in Amsterdam gettin high again
You know what, come to think of it, yo, I'll have a Heineken
Inhale it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound* blow it out yo nose

[Chorus]
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell

And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on (Swerve)
And then another one text (Swerve, swerve,) then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like—

I don't fuck wit' you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean, E-40]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a (E-40)

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do (Hawoo)
I don't give a fuck, uh

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich (Hella rich)
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio (Arsenio)
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless (Uh,) you might end up domeless (Uh)
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty (Mmm)
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth (Pour up)
Why you always comin' around with bad news? (Bad news)
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose (Hope I lose)
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew (Crew,) but them niggas cool (Cool)
It's just that—
[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean, E-40]
I don't fuck wit' you (Lil' biatch)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Uh-uh)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus (Extended): Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do (You)
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I don't give a
Fuck about you, or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for (God)
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for (Swerve, swerve, swerve)
Yeah, I got a lot, but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor (Floor)
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up (Uh)
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up (Uh)
That shit can break ya down, if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up (Yup)
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious (Woah,) feel me
When you get a fine bitch, just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma too real, so I hope you doin' cool
But still—
[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
No, no, no, no
Little stupid ass, I ain't fuckin' wit' (Woah)
I ain't fuckin', I ain't, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Woah)

Straight up, yeah, yeah

Who you trying to get crazy with, ése?
Don't you know I'm loco?

[Verse 1: B-Real]
To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the frying pan
Like Spam, get done when I come and slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair, got me going like General Electric
And the lights are blinking, I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Oh, making my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big four-o
Bro, I got to maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is going insane

Fat boy on a diet, don't try it

My shit's fat, like a sumo, slamming that ass
Leavin' your face in the grass
You know I don't take a do low lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Like Louie Armstrong played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon, I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes, I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make your eyes strain
A nigga like me is going insane

Oh
Let's pull the two-seater out baby
It's where ever you wanna go!
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my two-seater she's the one that I would take, wee

Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100

Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came

[Verse 3: Drake]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
Twenty-three and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

[Verse 1]
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on the West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
'Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that’s why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you

We can pretend if you want to, like

'Cause either way we both lying more than half of the time
Except for when I’m home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other, I'm taking you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian girl-in-the-back car
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats
Watching lames handle they fame, they bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Analling anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow, she still look good though
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass; not a 10, but a super 8
You ain't see me at the show? I was super great
Hotel penthouse, gon' and let it ruminate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept going

Ooh, girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry? 'Cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh, girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say I'm a piece of shit

Act one, scene four

[Chorus]
Yeah, run, Ricky, run, run nigga, run, jump, nigga, jump
Come here they come, run, run, run, run
Gun with the drum, bum bitty bum, slump in the trunk
My city go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
151 rum and a blunt
Young nigga numb, numb, numb and he got a little gun
A little bitty killer really doin' it for fun
Give him a little bit and he'll get a nigga done

[Verse]
Son of a god, son of a bitch
Son of woman and man, son of a son, in a sunken abyss
Summon a plan, please come with a script
Cover my back, cover man, please come with the blitz
Look at the stats, JID like a magician
Fuck that, this some real ass shit, I paid blood for this
Taking cheese from the government
Cereal boxes with the bugs in it
Hand me down, this my brother brother's shit
Don't compare me to no other other niggas
In the city, boy, they say they fucking with you
Heebie jeebie, that's a bit disgusting, but I get it
I'm full of tension, full of spirit but full of shit
Standing next to Lil Tay when that bullet hit him
Shit, I miss him, I wish that that bullet missed him but it didn't
And since I been living with it like a sickness
Intimate, infinite rhymes, give me the baton
A ticking, ticking time bomb, takin' the finish line
Look alive, look in my eyes, look at you niggas tryin'
And ya dumb, dumb, better run, run 'cause we fryin' em
Eastside, where ya from, from niggas wildin'
So be silent before my niggas creep silent
With street knowledge, complete nonsense
Delete comments, online, all lies, we see violence
Every day in my eyes, they killing my niggas, die, nigga die
Pull up with the fye, get 'em, nigga, it's eye for an eye
If we gotta ride, fuck it, nigga, ride for the ride of ya life
Diabolical minds, I don't mind it, I like it, I like it, I love it
I fuck with you, you a thug, I'ma thug with you
We can knuck, we can buck if a nigga fuck with you
I got love for you out the mud with you, off the muscle

Bitch, you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, it gets shady
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson, or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the D-low, and he know

[Chorus]
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

[Verse 2]
Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol popping, Poppy Street

[Verse 3]
Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit

But I'm always on time (Holla back)
And I gave you my all (Beyotch, heh, heh)
Now baby be mine

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (Shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyein' me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like, the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I.N.C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time (yeah)
And I gave you my all (yo)
Now baby be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh I, feelin' like you livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be coming home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checking for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call
But I'm always on time
And I gave you my all
Now baby be mine

Mista Dobalina, Mista Bob Dobalina
Mista Bob Dobalina, won't you quit?
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies
But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies

You thought you could fool me, ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina
Cheech Wizard used to put me on a stump
And then he schooled me

[Verse 2]
Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the façade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me, Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key, Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee, Dobalina

Mirror mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls
She bubblin', we fuckin', then you cuddlin'
Like, baby, where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
'Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion
Yeah, she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the feds
So she says she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are

I'm the Mac and I'm bad, give ya something that you never had
I'll make ya bump, hump, wiggle and shake your rump
'Cause I'll be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna jump
How high? Real high 'cause I'm just so fly
A young lovable, huggable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside out, it's wiggida wiggida wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin'
R&B rap is bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'
Ain't nuthin' soft about Kris Kross, we all that

[Интро: Future & Tems]
Я буду ждать тебя, ждать тебя
Ранним утром или поздней ночью (Я буду ждать тебя)
Время не имеет значения (Я буду ждать тебя)

Как только я нахожу время, все в порядке (Эй)

[Куплет 1: Future]
Ты молишься за моих демонов, детка, я тебя понял
Каждый раз, когда я пью лин, я становлюсь уязвимым
Я знаю звуки грома, когда он приходит
Она понимает, я не могу брать ее туда, куда иду
Я был в поле, как дети кукурузы

[Припев: Future & Tems]
Я могу слышать твои слезы, когда они падают на телефон
Злишься на себя, потому что не можешь оставить меня в покое
Сплетни, грязь, это не то, что мы делаем (Мир был окончен)
Путешествую по миру (Ты будешь плакать или попытаешься добраться до меня?)
На телефон капают слезы (Скажи мне сейчас, я хочу, чтобы ты ясно выразился, да)
Становлюсь уязвимым, когда принимаю таблетки (Скажи мне сейчас, мне нужно, чтобы ты ясно выразился, да)
Когда ты пьяна, скажи мне, что ты чувствуешь (Я буду ждать тебя, ждать тебя)
Когда я пьян, я вижу реальность (Я буду ждать тебя, я буду ждать тебя)
Пожалуйста, скажи, что это (Я буду ждать, буду ждать тебя, тебя )
Не говоришь это, потому что знаешь, что я хочу услышать (Я буду ждать тебя, я буду ждать тебя)

Да, я объездил весь мир
Я сижу на балконе и удивляюсь, как ты себя чувствуешь
Моя карьера, отнимает время у женщин
Я не могу убедить тебя в том, что буду любить тебя до конца жизни (Я буду ждать тебя, ждать тебя)
Я на твоей линии, чувства текут как река
Ты отвечаешь в Kiki on the River (Я буду ждать тебя)
Сообщение доставлено (Я буду ждать тебя), но я знаю, что ты не ответишь
Зачем нас познакомила, если знала, что вы вместе? (Я буду ждать тебя, тебя, тебя)
Заставила меня пожать ему руку, когда вы знакомы пару ебаных минут (Я буду ждать, тебя)
Заставляешь ходить по планке, знаешь, что я пловец (Я буду ждать тебя)
Должен был стать твоим псом, но ты посадила в будку
Детка, закрой намордником, весь этот лай за ужином
Я издевался над тобой, когда у тебя был крошечный президент
Ты стала лучше, когда встретила меня, и это не совпадение
Пытался выбить из тебя самое лучшее, наверное, я не настолько влиятелен
Думаю, я не тот, кто предназначен для тебя

Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I'm sweeter and thicker than a Chick-O-Stick
Here's an ice cream cone honey take a lick
Or go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick
Wore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a whiff of this, miss
Just left the yard boys, now I'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green and have a glass of wine
He say, she say, I heard it through the grapevine
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Teasin, skeezin, all so pleasin
Don't ask why I got my own reasons
Smooth B, Greg Nice, Slick Nick clique
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick...

Sometimes I rhyme slow
Sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 125 and Saint Nick
Waiting on a cab, standing in the rain
Under my heart three clouds of pain
She got the best of me
What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, noone could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting ends
She was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow, I need blow
And I said whoa, little hottie
I'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know
In 18 months she came home and I let her back in
And now she's sniffing again...

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty
Having me, then he told the people ""You can call me Your Majesty""
Keep your battery charged, you know it won't stick yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter, peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (""Your mother—""), don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa, whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try, villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out the square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you, it's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'

We thank Him for his prophets, and the scriptures which they brought. We thank him for Moses and the Torah. We thank him for Jesus and the Gospel. We thank him for Muhammad aoran. Peace be upon these worthy servants of Allah.

I am so grateful to Allah for his intervention in our affairs in the person of Master Farad Muhammad the Great Madi, who came among us and raised from among us a divine leader, teacher and guide, his messenger to us the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad. I greet all of you, my dear and wonderful brothers, with the greeting words of peace. We say it in the Arabic language, Asalam Eleecum.

I would like to thank all of those known and unknown persons who worked to make this day of atonement and reconciliation a reality. My thanks and my extreme gratitude to the Reverend Benjamin Chavis and to all of the members of the national organizing committees.

To all of the local organizing committees, to Dr. Dorothy Height in the National Council of Negro Women, and all of the sisters who were involved in the planning of the Million Man March. Of course, if I named all those persons whom I know helped to make this event a reality, it would take a tremendous amount of time. But suffice it to say that we are grateful to all who made this day possible.

I'm looking at the Washington Monument and beyond it to the Lincoln Memorial. And, beyond that, to the left, to your right, the Jefferson Memorial. Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of these United States and he was the man who allegedly freed us.

Abraham Lincoln saw in his day, what President Clinton sees in this day. He saw the great divide between black and white. Abraham Lincoln and Bill Clinton see what the Kerner Commission saw 30 years ago when they said that this nation was moving toward two Americas -- one Black, one White, separate and unequal. And the Kerner Commission revisited their findings 25 years later and saw that America was worse today than it was in the time of Martin Luther King, Jr. There's still two Americas, one Black, one White, separate and unequal.

Abraham Lincoln, when he saw this great divide, he pondered a solution of separation. Abraham Lincoln said he never was in favor of our being jurors or having equal status with the Whites of this nation. Abraham Lincoln said that if there were to be a superior or inferior, he would rather the superior position be assigned to the White race. There, in the middle of this mall is the Washington Monument, 555 feet high. But if we put a one in front of that 555 feet, we get 1555, the year that our first fathers landed on the shores of Jamestown, Virginia as slaves.

In the background is the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorial, each one of these monuments is 19 feet high.

Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president. Thomas Jefferson, the third president, and 16 and three make 19 again. What is so deep about this number 19? Why are we standing on the Capitol steps today? That number 19 -- when you have a nine you have a womb that is pregnant. And when you have a one standing by the nine, it means that there's something secret that has to be unfolded.

Right here on this mall where we are standing, according to books written on Washington, D.C., slaves used to be brought right here on this Mall in chains to be sold up and down the eastern seaboard. Right along this mall, going over to the White House, our fathers were sold into slavery. But, George Washington, the first president of the United States, said he feared that before too many years passed over his head, this slave would prove to become a most troublesome species of property.

Thomas Jefferson said, he trembled for this country when he reflected that God was just and that his justice could not sleep forever. Well, the day that these presidents feared has now come to pass, for on this mall, here we stand in the capital of America. and the layout of this great city, laid out by a Black man, Benjamin Banneker. This is all placed and based in a secret Masonic ritual. And at the core of the secret of that ritual is the Black man, not far from here is the White House.

And the first president of this land, George Washington, who was a grand master of the Masonic order laid the foundation, the cornerstone of this capitol building where we stand. George was a slave owner. George was a slave owner. Now, the President spoke today and he wanted to heal the great divide. But I respectfully suggest to the President, you did not dig deep enough at the malady that divides Black and White in order affect a solution to the problem.

And so, today, we have to deal with the root so that perhaps a healing can take place.
Now, this obelisk at the Washington Monument is Egyptian and this whole layout is reminiscent of our great historic past, Egypt. And, if you look at the original Seal of the United States, published by the Department of State in 1909. Gaylord Hunt wrote that late in the afternoon of July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress resolved that Dr. Benjamin Franklin, Mr. John Adams, and Mr. Thomas Jefferson be a committee to prepare a device for a Seal of the United States of America.

In the design proposed by the first committee, the face of the Seal was a coat of arms measured in six quarters. That number is significant. Six quarters, with emblems representing England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany and Holland, the countries from which the new nation had been peopled. The eye of providence in a radiant triangle and the motto, ""E Pluribus Unum"" were also proposed for the face of the Seal. Even the country was populated by so-called Indians and Black Slaves were brought to build the country, the official Seal of the country was never designed to reflect our presence, only that of the European immigrants. The Seal and the Constitution reflect the thinking of the founding fathers, that this was to be a nation by White people and for White people. Native Americans, Blacks, and all other non-White people were to be the burden bearers for the real citizens of this nation.

For the back of the Seal the committee suggested a picture of Pharoah sitting in an open chariot with a crown on his head and a sword in his hand, passing through the divided waters of the Red Sea, in pursuit of the Israelites. And, hovering over the sea was to be shown a pillar of fire in a cloud, expressive of the divine presence and command.

And raised from this pillar of fire were to be shown, beaming down on Moses standing on the shore, extending his hand over the sea, causing it to overwhelm Pharoah.

The motto for the reverse was, ""Rebellion To Tyrants Is Obedience To God."" Let me say it again. Rebellion is obedience to God. Now, why did they mention Pharaoh? I heard the President say to today E Pluribus Unum -- out of many, one.

But in the past, out of many comes one meant out of many Europeans come one people. The question today is, out of the many Asians, the many Arabs, the many Native Americans, the many Blacks, the many people of color who populate this country. Do you mean for them to be made into the one?

If so, truth has to be spoken to justice. We can't cover things up. Cover them over. Give it a pretty sound to make people feel good. We have to go to the root of the problem. Now, why have you come today?

You came not at the call of Louis Farrakhan, but you have gathered here at the call of God. For it is only the call of Almighty God, no matter through whom that call came, that could generate this kind of outpouring. God called us here to this place. At this time. For a very specific reason.

And now, I want to say, my brothers -- this is a very pregnant moment. Pregnant with the possibility of tremendous change in our status in America and in the world. And although the call was made through me, many have tried to distance the beauty of this idea from the person through whom the idea and the call was made.

Some have done it mistakenly. And others have done it in a malicious and vicious manner. Brothers and sisters, there is no human being through whom God brings an idea that history doesn't marry the idea with that human being no matter what defect was that human being's character.

You can't separate Newton from the law that Newton discovered, nor can you separate Einstein from the theory of relativity. It would be silly to try to separate Moses from the Torah or Jesus from the Gospel or Muhammad from the Koran.

When you say Farrakhan, you ain't no Moses, you ain't no Jesus, and you're not no Muhammad. You have a defect in your character.

Well, that certainly may be so, however, according to the way the Bible reads, there is no profit of God written of in the Bible that did not have a defect in his character. But, I have never heard any member of the faith of Judaism separate David from the Psalms, because of what happened in David's life and you're never separated Solomon from the building of the Temple because they say he had a thousand concubines, and you never separated any of the Great Servants of God.
So today, whether you like it or not, God brought the idea through me and he didn't bring it through me because my heart was dark with hatred and anti-semitism, he didn't bring it through me because my heart was dark and I'm filled with hatred for White people and for the human family of the planet. If my heart were that dark, how is the message so bright, the message so clear, the response so magnificent?

(APPLAUSE)

So, we stand here today at this historic moment. We are standing in the place of those who couldn't make it here today. We are standing on the blood of our ancestors. We are standing on the blood of those who died in the middle passage, who died in the fields and swamps of America, who died hanging from trees in the South, who died in the cells of their jailers, who died on the highways and who died in the fratricidal conflict that rages within our community. We are standing on the sacrifice of the lives of those heroes, our great men and women that we today may accept the responsibility that life imposes upon each traveler who comes this way.

We must accept the responsibility that God has put upon us, not only to be good husbands and fathers and builders of our community, but God is now calling upon the despised and the rejected to become the cornerstone and the builders of a new world.

And so, our brief subject today is taken from the American Constitution. In these words, Toward a more union. Toward a more perfect union.

Now, when you use the word more with perfect, that which is perfect is that which has been brought to completion. So, when you use more perfect, you're either saying that what you call perfect is perfect for that stage of its development but not yet complete. When Jefferson said, ""toward a more perfect union,"" he was admitting that the union was not perfect, that it was not finished, that work had to be done. And so we are gathered here today not to bash somebody else.

We're not gathered here to say, all of the evils of this nation. But we are gathered here to collect ourselves for a responsibility that God is placing on our shoulders to move this nation toward a more perfect union. Now, when you look at the word toward, toward, it means in the direction of, in furtherance or partial fulfillment of, with the view to obtaining or having shortly before coming soon, eminent, going on in progress. Well, that's right. We're in progress toward a perfect union. Union means bringing elements or components into unity.

It is something formed by uniting two or more things. It is a number of persons, states, etcetera, which are joined or associated together for some common purpose. We're not here to tear down America. America is tearing itself down. We are here to rebuild the wasted cities. What we have in the word toward is motion. The honorable Elijah Muhammad taught us that motion is the first law of the universe. This motion which takes us from one point to another shows that we are evolving and we are a part of a universe that is ever evolving.

We are on an evolutionary course that will bring us to perfect or completion of the process toward a perfect union with God. In the word toward there is a law and that law is everything that is crated is in harmony with the law of evolution, change. Nothing is standing still.

It is either moving toward perfection or moving toward disintegration. Or under certain circumstances doing both things at the same time. The word for this evolutionary changing affecting stage after stage until we reach perfection. In Arabic it is called Rhab. And from the word Rhab you get the Rhaby, or teacher, one who nourishes a people from one stage and brings them to another stage. Well, if we are in motion and we are, motion toward perfection and we are, there can be no motion toward perfection without the Lord, who created the law of evolution.

And is the master of the changes. Our first motion then must be toward the God, who created the law of the evolution of our being. And if our motion toward him is right and proper, then our motion toward a perfect union with each other and government and with the peoples of the world will be perfected. So, let us start with a process leading to that perfect union must first be seen. Now, brothers and sisters, the day of atonement is established by God to help us achieve a closer tie with the source of wisdom, knowledge, understanding and power.

For it is only through a closer union or tie with him, who created us all, with him who has power over all things that we can draw power, knowledge, wisdom and understanding from him, that we maybe enable to change the realities of our life. A perfect union with God is the idea at the base of atonement. Now, atonement demands of us eight steps, in fact, atonement is the fifth step in an eight stage process.

Look at our division, not here, out there. We are a people, who have been fractured, divided and destroyed because of our division now must move toward a perfect union. But let's look at a speech delivered by a White slave holder on the banks of the James River in 1712.
Sixty-eight years before our former slave masters permitted us to join the Christian faith. Listen to what he said. He said, ""In my bag I have a fool proof method of controlling black slaves. I guarantee everyone of you, if installed correctly, it will control the slaves for at least 300 years. My method is simple. Any member of your family or your overseer can use it. I have outlined a number of differences among the slaves and I take these differences and I make them bigger. I use fear, distrust, and envy for control purposes.""

I want you to listen. What are those three things? Fear, envy, distrust. For what purpose? Control. To control who? The slave. Who is the slave? Us. Listen, he said, ""These methods have worked on my modest plantation in the West Indies and they will work throughout the south.

Now, take this simple little list and think about it. On the top of my list is age. But it's only there because it starts with an A. And the second is color or shade. There's intelligence, sex, size of plantation, status of plantation, attitude of owners, whether the slaves live in the valley or on a hill, north, east, south or west, have fine hair or course hair, or is tall or short.

Now that you have a list of differences I shall give you an outline of action. But before that, I shall assure you that distrust is stronger than trust. And envy is stronger than adulation, respect, or admiration.

The black slave after receiving this indoctrination shall carry it on and will become self-refueling and self-generating for hundreds of years. Maybe thousands of years. Now don't forget, you must pitch the old black male against the young black male. And the young black male against the old black male.

You must use the female against the male. And you must use the male against the female. You must use the dark skinned slave against the light skinned slave. And the light skinned slave against the dark skinned slave.

You must also have your white servants and overseers distrust all blacks. But it is necessary that your slaves trust and depend on us. They must love, respect, and trust only us.

""Gentlemen, these keys are your keys to control. Use them. Never miss an opportunity. And if used intensely for one year, the slaves themselves will remain perpetually distrustful. Thank you, gentlemen."" End of quote. So spoke Willie Lynch 283 years ago.

And so, as a consequence, we as a people now have been fractured, divided and destroyed, filled with fear, distrust and envy. Therefore, because of fear, envy and distrust of one another, many of us as leaders, teachers, educators, pastors and persons are still under the control mechanism of our former slave masters and their children.

And now, in spite of all that division, in spite of all that divisiveness. we responded to a call and look at what is present here today. We have here those brothers with means and those who have no means. Those who are light and those who are dark. Those who are educated, those who are uneducated. Those who are business people, those who don't know anything about business. Those who are young, those who are old. Those who are scientific, those who know nothing of science. Those who are religious and those who are irreligious. Those who are Christian, those who are Muslim, those who are Baptist, those who are Methodist, those who are Episcopalian, those of traditional African religion. We've got them all here today.

And why did we come? We came because we want to move toward a more perfect union. And if you notice, the press triggered every one of those divisions. You shouldn't come, you're a Christian. That's a Muslim thing. You shouldn't come, you're too intelligent to follow Hate! You shouldn't come, look at what they did, they excluded women, you see? They played all the cards, they pulled all the strings.

Oh, but you better look again, Willie. There's a new Black man in America today. A new Black woman in America today. Now Brothers, there's a social benefit of our gathering here today. That is, that from this day forward, we can never again see ourselves through the narrow eyes of the limitation of the boundaries of our own fraternal, civic, political, religious, street organization or professional organization. We are forced by the magnitude of what we see here today, that whenever you return to your cities and you see a Black man, a Black woman, don't ask him what is your social, political or religious affiliation, or what is your status? Know that he is your brother.

You must live beyond the narrow restrictions of the divisions that have been imposed upon us. Well, some of us are here because it's history making. Some of us are here because it's a march through which we ca express anger and rage with America for what she has and is doing to us. So, we're here for many reasons but the basic reason while this was called was for atonement and reconciliation. So, it is necessary for me in as short of time as possible to give as full an explanation of atonement as possible.

As I said earlier, atonement is the fifth stage in an eight stage process. So, let's go back to the first stage of the process that brings us into perfect union with God. And the first stage is the most difficult of all because when we are wrong, and we are not aware of it, someone has to point out the wrong. I want to, I want to say this again, but I want to say it slowly. And I really want each one of these points to sink in. How many of us in this audience, at some time or another have been wrong? Would we just raise our hands?

OK. Now, when we are wrong, Lord knows we want to be right. The most difficult thing is when somebody points it out do we accept it, do we reject it, do we hate the person who pointed out our wrong. How do we treat the person who points out our wrong? Now, I want you to follow me. When you go to a doctor, you're not feeling well, the doctor says, what's wrong? Well, I don't know, doc. Well, where is the pain? Tell me something about the symptoms. You want the doctor to make a correct diagnosis. You don't smack the doctor when he points out what's wrong.

You don't hate the doctor when he points out what's wrong. You say, thank you, doctor. What's my prescription for healing? We all right? Now, look, whoever is entrusted with the task of pointing out wrong, depending on the nature of the circumstances is not always loved.

In fact, more than likely, that person is going to be hated and misunderstood. Such persons are generally hated because no one wants to be shown as being wrong. Particularly when you're dealing with governments, with principalities, with powers, with rulers, with administrations. When you're dealing with forces which have become entrenched in their evil, intractable and unyielding their power produces an arrogance. And their arrogance produces a blindness. And out of that evil state of mind, they will do all manner of evil to the person who points out their wrong. Even though you're doing good for them by pointing out where America went wrong.

Now, Martin Luther King, Jr. was probably the most patriotic Americans. More patriotic George Washington. More patriotic than Thomas Jefferson. More patriotic than many of the presidents because he had the courage to point out what was wrong in the society. And because he pointed out what was wrong, he was ill spoken of, vilified, maligned, hated and eventually, murdered.

Brother Malcolm had that same road to travel. He pointed out what was wrong in the society and he had to suffer for pointing out what was wrong and he ultimately died on the altar for pointing out what was wrong. Inside the Nation, outside the Nation, to the greater nation and to the smaller nation.

We talking about moving toward a perfect union. Well, pointing out fault, pointing out our wrongs is the first step.

The second step is to acknowledge. Oh, thank you. Oh, man, I'm wrong. To acknowledge means to admit the existence, the reality or the truth of some reality. It is to recognize as being valid. Or having force and power. It is to express thanks, appreciation, or gratitude. So in this context, the word acknowledgement to be in a state of recognition of the truth of the fact that we have been wrong. This is the second step.

Well, the third step is that after you know you're wrong and you acknowledge it to yourself, who else knows it except you confess it. You say, well, yeah, all right. But who should I confess to? And why should I confess?

And why should I confess? The Bible says confession is good for the soul. Now, brothers I know, I don't have a lot of time, but the soul is the essence of a person's being. And when the soul is covered with guilt from sin and wrongdoing, the mind and the actions of the person reflect the condition of the soul. So, to free the soul or the essence of man from its burden, one must acknowledge one's wrong, but then one must confess.

The Holy Koran says it like this: I've been greatly unjust to myself, and I confess my faults. So grant me protection against all my faults, for none grants protection against faults but Thee. It is only through confession that we can be granted protection from the consequences of our faults.

For every deed has a consequence. And we can never be granted protection against the faults that we refuse to acknowledge or that we are unwilling to confess. So, look. Who should you confess to? I don't want to confess. Who should you confess to? Who should I confess to? Who should we confess to? First, you confess to God. And everyone of us that are here today, that knows that we have done wrong. We have to go to God and speak to Him in the privacy of our rooms and confess. He already knows, but when you confess, you're relieving your soul of the burden that it bears.

But, then, the hardest part is to go to the person or persons whom your faults have ill-affected and confess to them. That's hard. That's hard. But, if we want a perfect union, we have to confess the fault. Well, what happens after confession? There must be repentance. When you repent, you feel remorse or contrition or shame for the past conduct which was and is wrong and sinful. It means to feel contrition or self-reproach for what one has done or failed to do.

And, it is the experiencing of such regret for past conduct that involves the changing of our mind toward that sin. So, until we repent and feel sick, sorry over what we have done, we can never, never change our minds toward that thing. And if you don't repent, you'll do it over and over and over again. But to stop it where it is, and Black men, we got to stop what we're doing where it is. We cannot continue the destruction of our lives and the destruction of our community. But that change can't come until we feel sorry.

I heard my brother from the West Coast say today, I atone to the mothers for the death of the babies caused by our senseless slaughter of one another. See, when he feels sorry deep down inside, he's going to make a change.

That man has a change in his mind. That man has a change in his heart. His soul has been unburdened and released from the pain of that sin, but you got to go one step further, because after you've acknowledged it, confessed it, repented, you've come to the fifth stage. Now, you've got to do something about it.

Now, look brother, sisters. Some people don't mind confessing. Some people don't mind making some slight repentance. But, when it comes to doing something about the evil that we've done we fall short.

But, atonement means satisfaction or reparation for a wrong or injury. It means to make amends. It means penance, expiation, compensation and recompense made or done for an injury or wrong.

So, atonement means we must be willing to do something in expiation of our sins so we can't just have a good time today, and say we made history in Washington. We've got to resolve today that we're going back home to do something about what's going on in our lives and in our families and in our communities.

Now, we all right? Can you hang with me a few more? Now, brothers and sisters, if we make atonement it leads to the sixth stage. And the sixth stage is forgiveness. Now, so many of us want forgiveness, but we don't want to go through the process that leads to it. And so, when we say we forgive, we forgive from our lips, but we have never pardoned in the heart.

So, the injury still remains. My dear family. My dear brothers. We need forgiveness. God is always ready to forgive us for our sins. Forgiveness means to grant pardon for, or remission of, an offense or sin. It is to absolve, to clear, to exonerate and to liberate. Boy, that's something!

See, you're not liberated until you can forgive. You're not liberated from the evil effect of our own sin until we can ask God for forgiveness and then forgive others, and this is why in the Lord's Prayer you say, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

So, it means to cease, to feel offense and resentment against another for the harm done by an offender. It means to wipe the slate clean. And then, that leads to the seventh stage. You know, I like to liken this to music. Because in music, the seventh note is called a leading tone. Do, re, me, fa, so, la, te..You can't stop there. Te.

It leaves you hung up, te. What you got to get back to? Doe. So, whatever you started with when you reach the eight note, you're back to where you started only at a higher vibration. Now, look, at this. The seventh tone, the leading tone that leads to the perfect union with God is reconciliation and restoration because after forgiveness, now, we are going to be restored to what? To our original position. To restore, to reconcile means to become friendly, peaceable again, to put hostile persons into a state of agreement or harmony, to make compatible or to compose or settle what it was that made for division.

It means to resolve differences. It can mean to establish or re- establish a close relationship between previously hostile persons. So, restoration means the act of returning something to an original or un-impaired condition. Now, when you're backed to an impaired position, you have reached the eighth stage, which is perfect union. And when we go through all these steps, there is no difference between us, that we can't heal. There's a bomb in Gilead to heal the sin sick soul. There is a bomb in Gilead to make the wounded whole.

We are a wounded people but we're being healed, but President Clinton, America is also wounded. And there's hostility now in the great divide between the people. Socially the fabric of America is being torn a part and it's black against black, black against white, white against white, white against black, yellow against brown, brown against yellow. We are being torn a part. And we can't gloss it over with nice speeches, my dear, Mr. President.

Sir, with all due respect, that was a great speech you made today. And you praised the marchers and they're worthy of praise. You honored the marchers and they are worthy of honor. But of course, you spoke ill indirectly of me, as a purveyor of malice and hatred.

I must hasten to tell you, Mr. President, that I'm not a malicious person, and I'm not filled with malice. But, I must tell you that I come in the tradition of the doctor who has to point out, with truth, what's wrong. And the pain is that power has made America arrogant. Power and wealth has made America spiritually blind and the power and the arrogance of America makes you refuse to hear a child of your slaves pointing out the wrong in your society.

But, I think if you could clear the scales from your eyes, sir, and give ear to what we say, perhaps, oh perhaps, what these great speakers who spoke before me said, and my great and wonderful brother, the Reverend Jesse Jackson said, and perhaps, just perhaps from the children of slaves might come a solution to this Pharaoh and this Egypt as it was with Joseph when they had to get him out of prison and wash him up and clean him up because Pharaoh had some troubling dreams that he didn't have any answer to. And he called his soothsayers and he called the people that read the stars and he called all his advisors, but nobody could help him to solve the problem. But he had to go to the children of slaves, because he heard that there was one in prison who knew the interpretation of dreams. And he said bring him, bring him and let me hear what he has to say.

God has put it for you in the scriptures, Mr. President. Balshasar and Nebuchadnezer couldn't read the handwriting on the wall. But, Daniel had to read the handwriting for him. Manne, manne, tek elauhu phossen (PH) (your kingdom has been weighed in the balance and has been found wanting).

Do you want a solution to the dilemma that America faces? Then, don't look at our skin color, because racism will cause you to reject salvation if it comes in the skin of a black person. Don't look at the kinkiness of our hair and the broadness of our nose and the thickness of our lips, but listen to the beat of our hearts and the pulsating rhythm of the truth. Perhaps, perhaps, you might be as wise as that Pharaoh and save this great nation.

And so, the eighth stage is perfect union with god. And in the Koran, it reads. ""Oh soul that is at rest, well pleased with thy lord and well pleasing."" Oh, brothers, brothers, brothers, you don't know what its like to be free. Freedom can't come from white folks. Freedom can't come from staying here and petitioning this great government. We're here to make a statement to the great government, but not to beg them. Freedom cannot come from no one but the god who can liberate the soul from the burden of sin. And this is why Jesus said ""come unto me"", not some who are heavy laden, ""but all that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"".

But listen, all of these eight steps take place in a process called time. And whenever a nation is involved in sin to the point that god intends to judge and destroy that nation, he always sends someone to make that nation or people know their sins, to reflect on it, to acknowledge, to confess, to repent and to atone that they might find forgiveness with god. America, oh America. This great city of Washington is like Jerusalem. And the Bible says ""Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem, you that stoneth and killith the prophets of God.""

Right from this beautiful Capitol and from the beautiful White House have come commands to kill the prophets. David's trouble came from this house. Martin Luther King's trouble came from this house. Malcolm's trouble came from this house. W. E. B. Dubois' trouble came from this house. And from this house, you stoned and killed the prophets of God that would have liberated Black people, liberated America. But I stand here today knowing, knowing that you are angry. That have my people have validated me. I don't need you to validate me.

I don't need to be in any mainstream.

I want to wash in the river of Jordan and the river that you see and the sea that is before us and behind us and around us.

It's validation. That's the mainstream. You're out of touch with reality. A few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms, calling that the mainstream while the masses of the people, white and black, red, yellow, and brown, poor and vulnerable are suffering in this nation.

Well, America, great America. Like Jerusalem that stoned and killed the prophets of God. That a work has been done in you today unlike any work that's ever been done in this great city. I wonder what you'll say tomorrow?

I wonder what you'll write in your newspapers and magazines, tomorrow. Will you give God the glory? Will you give God the glory? Will you respect the beauty of this day? All of these black men that the world sees as savage, maniacal, and bestial. Look at them. A sea of peace. A sea of tranquility. A sea of men ready to come back to God. Settle their differences and go back home to turn our communities into decent and safe places to live.

America. America, the beautiful. There's no country like this on the earth. And certainly if I lived in another country, I might never have had the opportunity to speak as I speak today. I probably would have been shot outright and so would my brother, Jesse, and so would Molani Karenga (PH) and so would Dr. Ben Chavis and Reverend Al Sampson and the wonderful people that are here.

But because this is America you allow me to speak even though you don't like what I may say. Because this is America, that provision in the constitution for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and freedom of religion, that is your saving grace.

Because what you're under right now is grace. And grace is the expression of divine love and protection which God bestows freely on people.

God is angry, America. He's angry, but His mercy is still present. Brothers and sisters look at the inflictions that have come upon us in the black community. Do you know why we're being afflicted? God wants us to humble ourselves to the message that will make us atone and come back to Him and make ourselves whole again. But why is God afflicting America? Why is God afflicting the world? Why did Jesus say there would be wars and rumors of wars, and earthquakes in diverse places and pestilence and famine, and why did He say that these were just the beginning of sorrows?

In the last ten years America has experienced more calamities than at any other time period in American history. Why America? God is angry. He's not angry because you're right. He's angry because you're wrong and you want to stone and kill the people who want to make you see you're wrong. And so, the Bible says Elijah must first come. Why should Elijah come? Elijah has the job of turning the hearts of the children back to their fathers, and the father's heart back to the children. Elijah becomes an axis upon which people turn back to God and God turns back to the people. And that's why it said Elijah must first come. And so, here we are, 400 years, fulfilling Abraham's prophecy.

Some of our friends in the religious community have said, why should you take atonement? That was for the children of Israel. I say yes, it was. But atonement for the children of Israel prefigured our suffering here in America. Israel was in bondage to Pharaoh 400 years. We've been in America 440 years. They were under affliction. We're under affliction. They're under oppression. We're under oppression. God said that nation which they shall serve, I will judge. Judgment means God is making a decision against systems, against institutions, against principalities and powers. And that's why Paul said, we war not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world and spiritual wickedness in high places.

God is sending his decision. I can't help it. If I've got to make the decision known. You don't understand me. My people love me.

And yet, I point out the evils of Black people like no other leader does, but my people don't call me anti-Black, because they know I must love them in order to point out what's wrong so we can get it right to come back into the favor of God!

But, let me say in truth, you can't point out wrong with malice. You can't point out wrong with hatred. Because, if we point out wrong with bitterness and hatred, then the bitterness and the hatred becomes a barrier between you and the person whom you hope to get right, that they might come into the favor of God.

So, we ask Muslims who, in our first stage, yeah, we pointed out the wrong of America, but we didn't point it out with no love, we point it out with the pain of our hurt. The pain of our suffering. The bitterness of our life story. But, we have grown beyond our bitterness. We have transcended beyond our pain. Why? It's easy for us to say, the White man did this, the White man that, the White man did the other, he deprived us of that. He killed the Indians. He did this. Yes, he did all of that.

But, why did God let him do that? That's the bigger question. And since we are not man enough to question God, we start beating up on the agent who is fulfilling prophesy. But, if we can transcend our pain to get up into God's mind, and ask God, God, why did you let our fathers come into bondage? God, why did you let us die in the Middle Passage? God, why did you suffer us to be in the hull of ships? God, why did you let him lash us, why did you let him beat us, why did you let him castrate us? Why did you let him hang us? Why did you let him burn us? Why, God, why, why, why?

We got a right to question God. That's the only way we can become wise. And if we question him like Job did, God may bring you up into his own thinking.

And if God were to answer us today he would say to Black people, yes, I allowed this to happen. And I know you suffered, but Martin King, my servant, said it, undeserved suffering is redemptive.

A whole world is lost, not just you Black people. A whole world has gone out of the way, not just you Black people. You the lost sheep, but the whole world is lost. You the bottom rail, but the one that put the you on the bottom is in the bottom with you holding you down. He's in the bottomless pit himself.

He said, Black Man, I love you. He said, but God, I mean, that's a heck of a way to show me you love me. He said, but I love my son. I love Jesus more than I love any of our servants. But I had a cross for him. I had nails for him. I had him to be rejected and despised. I had him falsely accused and brought before the courts of men. I had them spit on him. I had them to pierce his side. But, I loved him more than anybody else. Why, God?! Why did you do it? Why?

He said, I did it that I might be glorified, because like Jew, no matter what I did to him, he never cursed me, he never said My God ain't no good. He said whatever your will is, that's what I want to do and that's why, even though he descended into Hell, I have raised him to the limitless heights of Heaven, because only those who know the depths of Hell can appreciate the limitless heights of Heaven.

And so, my children, I caused you to suffer in the furnace of affliction so that I might purify you and resurrect you from a grave of death and ignorance. I, God, put in your soul, not a law written on stone, but I have written the law on the tablets of your heart.

So, I'm going to make a new covenant with you. Oh, Black Man. The secret of the Masonic Order is the secret of Hirem Obid (ph). The secret of the Masonic Order is a master builder that was hit in the head. The secret of the Masonic Order is a master that ruffians roughed up.

I think one of the ruffians was named Jubilo (ph) Furhman (ph). And another was named Jubilah (ph) Bilbow (ph). And another one was named Juilum (ph) Jesse Helms. These racists hit him in his head and carried him on a westerly course and buried him in the north country, in a shallow grave. Many tried to raise him up but they didn't have the master grip. It would take a master to come after him.

And this is why Matthew said, ""as lightening shines from the east, even unto the west, so shall the coming of the son of man be for whatsoever, the eagles are gathered together, there shall the carcass be."" Here's the carcass, the remains of a once mighty people, dry bones in the valley, a people slain from the foundation of the world. But God has sent the winds to blow on the bones. One of those winds is named Gingrich. And the companion wind is named Dole.

And the other is called Supreme Court decision. The other is fratracidal conflict, drugs and dope and violence and crime. But we've had enough now. This is why you're in Washington today. We've had enough. We've had enough distress, enough affliction. We're ready to bow down now. If my people, who are called by my name would just humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, forgive their sins, heal their land.

You are ready now to crime out of your furnace of affliction. You are ready now to accept the responsibility, oh, not just of the ghetto. God wants to purify you and lift you up, that you may call America and the world to repentance. Black man, you are a master builder, but you got hit in the head.

Black men, you're the descendants of the builders of the pyramids. But you have amnesia now. You can't remember how you did it. But the Master has come. You know, pastors, I love that scripture where Jesus told his disciples, go there and you'll see an ass and a colt tied with her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anybody ask you what you're doing, because it may look like you're stealing and you know they are going to accuse you of stealing, tell them the Master got need of these. And Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an ass.

The Democratic Party has for its symbol, a donkey. The donkey stands for the unlearned masses of the people. But the Democratic Party can't call them asses no more. You got them all tied up, but you're not using. The donkey is tied up. But can you get off today? No, I can't get off, I'm tied up. Somebody on your donkey? Well, yeah. I got a master. He rides me like the Master rode Balem's (ph) ass, you know. But, hail, the ass is now talking with a man's voice. And the ass wants to throw the rider off, because he got a new rider today.

If anybody ask you, tell them the Master has need. Look at you. Oh, I don't know what the number is. It's too much for me to count. But I think they said it's a million and a half, or two. I don't know how many. But you know, I called for a million. When I saw the word go out my mouth, I looked at it. I said oh my God! It just came out of my mouth. I didn't know. And after it came out, I said well I got to go with it. And, I'm so glad I did. People told me you better change that figure to one more realistic. And I should have changed it to the Three Million Man March.

Now, we're almost finished. I want to take one last look at the word atonement.

The first four letters of the word form the foundation; ""a-t-o-n"". . . ""a-ton"", ""a-ton"". Since this obelisk in front of us is representative of Egypt. In the 18th dynasty, a Pharaoh named Akhenaton, was the first man of this history period to destroy the pantheon of many gods and bring the people to the worship of one god. And that one god was symboled by a sun disk with 19 rays coming out of that sun with hands holding the Egyptian Ankh - the cross of life. A-ton. The name for the one god in ancient Egypt. A- ton, the one god. 19 rays. Look at your scripture.

A woman, remember the nine, means somebody pregnant, with an idea. But, in this case, its a woman pregnant with a male child destined to rule the nations with a rod of iron. God is standing over her womb, and this child will be like the day sun, and he will say ""I am the light of the world."" Hands coming out of that sun, come unto me all ye that are heavy laden. I'm gonna give you rest, but I'm gonna give you life, because I am the resurrection and the life and if you believe in me, though you are dead, yet shall you live again.

You're dead, Black man. But if you believe in the god who created this sun of truth and of light with 19 rays, meaning he's pregnant with God's spirit, God's life, God's wisdom. Abraham Lincoln's statue, 19 feet high, 19 feet wide. Jefferson, 19 feet high, 16 (OFF-MIKE) and the third president, 19. Standing on the steps of the Capitol, in the light of the sun. Offering life to a people who are dead.

Black man, the a-ton represents the one God. In the Koran, Muhammad is called a light giving son. So if you look at the aton, add an ""e"" to it, and separate the ""a"" from the next four letters and you get the word a tone.

Atone means sound. And ""a"", the first letter of the alphabet and the first letter of the numerical system is one. So ""a"" equals one. So ""a"" sound means when you hear the ""a"" tone, you will hear the right sound. And when you hear the right sound from the one God calling you to divine life, you will respond. So what is the ""a"" tone? In music, a equals 440 vibrations. How long have we been in America? Four hundred and forty years.

Well, in the 440th year, from the one God, the aton will come the a tone and all of us got to tune up our lives by the sound of the a tone. Because we've got to atone for all that we have done wrong. And when you atone, if you take the ""t"" and couple it with the ""a"" and hyphenate it, you get at one. So when you atone you become at one. At one with who? The aton or the one God. Because you heard the a tone and you tuned up your life and now you're ready to make a new beginning.

So when you get at one, you get the next two letters. It is ""m"" ""e"". Me. Who is it that has to atone?

(AUDIENCE): Me.

Who went wrong?

(AUDIENCE): Me.

Who got to fix it?

(AUDIENCE): Me.

Who should we look to?

(AUDIENCE): Me.

Yes! And then if you add, if you add another letter to ""me"" you get an ""n"". What does that say?

(AUDIENCE): Men.

So Farrakhan called men. Why did you call men? Because in the beginning, God made man. And if we are at a new beginning, we got to make a man all over again, but make him in the image and the likeness of God.

Now, if you add the ""t"" on, you get the suffix ""ment."" Ment means action, process. The instrument or agent of an action or process. So when you say I'm atoning, you got to act on it. You got get in the process. You got to acknowledge your wrong, confess your wrong. Repent of your wrong. Atone for your wrong.

Then you'll get forgiveness, then reconciliation, and restoration. And then you're back to the aton. Oh, Lord.

Now brothers, let's close it out. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Now you know the Bible says in the 430th year of this sojourn they went out.

That's in a book called Exodus. Now the word exodus means departure -- a going out. A way out. What did we come to Washington for? We didn't come to Washington to petition the government for a way out of her. But to find a way out of our affliction. But a way out from something bigger than our affliction. Oh, man. When you say come out, what do you mean? You've got to come out from under the mind of a slave. We've got to come out from a mind that is self-afflicted with the evil of black inferiority. We've got to come into a new way of thinking.

Now brothers, sisters, I want to close this lecture with a special message to our President and to the Congress. There is a great divide, but the real evil in America is not white flesh, or black flesh. The real evil in America is the idea that undergirds the set up of the western world. And that idea is called white supremacy.

Now wait, wait, wait. Before you get angry. Those of you listening by television. You don't even know why you behave the way you behave.

I'm not telling you I'm a psychiatrist, but I do want to operate on your head. White supremacy is the enemy of both White people and Black people because the idea of White supremacy means you should rule because you're White, that makes you sick. And you've produced a sick society and a sick world. The founding fathers meant well, but they said, ""toward a more perfect union"". So, the Bible says, we know in part, we prophesy in part, but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away with.

So either, Mr. Clinton, we're going to do away with the mind-set of the founding fathers. You don't have to repudiate them like you've asked my brothers to do me. You don't have to say they were malicious, hate filled people. But you must evolve out of their mind- set. You see their minds was limited to those six European nations out of which this country was founded. But you've got Asians here. How are you going to handle that? You've got children of Africa here. How are you going to handle that?

You've got Arabs here. You've got Hispanics here. I know you call them illegal aliens, but hell, you took Texas from them by flooding Texas with people that got your mind. And now they're coming back across the border to what is Northern Mexico, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California. They don't see themselves as illegal aliens. I think they might see you as an illegal alien. You have to be careful how you talk to people. You have to be careful how you deal with people. The Native American is suffering today. He's suffering almost complete extinction. Now, he learned about bingo. You taught him. He learned about black jack. You taught him. He learned about playing roulette. You taught him. Now, he's making a lot of money. You're upset with him because he's adopted your ways. What makes you like this? See, you're like this because you're not well. You're not well. And in the light of today's global village, you can never harmonize with the Asians. You can't harmonize with the islands of the Pacific.

You can't harmonize with the dark people of the world who out number you 11 to one, if you're going to stand in the mind of white supremacy. White supremacy has to die in order for humanity to live.

(APPLAUSE)

Now, oh, I know. I know. I know it's painful, but we have to operate now, just, just take a little of this morphine and you won't feel the pain as much. You just need to bite down on something, as I stop this last few minutes, just bite down on your finger. Listen, listen, listen, listen, white supremacy caused you all, not you all, some White folk to try to rewrite history and write us out. White supremacy caused Napoleon to blow the nose off of the Sphinx because it reminded you too much of the Black man's majesty.

White supremacy caused you to take Jesus, a man with hair like lambs wool and feet like burnished brass and make him White. So that you could worship him because you could never see yourself honoring somebody Black because of the state of your mind. You see, you, you really need help. You'll be all right. You'll be all right. You will be all right. Now, now, now, you painted the Last Supper, everybody there White.

My mother asked the man that came to bring her the Bible. He said, look there, the pictures in the Bible. You see, Jesus and all his disciples are at the Last Supper -- my mother in her West Indian accent said, you mean ain't nobody Black was at the Last Supper?

(LAUGHTER)

And the man said, yes, but they was in the kitchen. So now you've whitened up everything.

Any great invention we made you put white on it, because you didn't want to admit that a Black person had that intelligence, that genius. You try to color everything to make it satisfactory to the sickness of our mind.

So you whitened up religion, Farrakhan didn't do that. You locked the bible from us, Farrakhan didn't do that. Your sick mind wouldn't even let you bury us in the same ground that both of us came out of. We had to be buried somewhere else, that's sick. Some of us died just to drink water out of a fountain marked White. That's sick. Isn't it sick?

You poisoned religion. And in all the churches, until recently, the master was painted white. So, you had us bowing down to your image. Which ill-effected our minds. You gave us your version of history. And you whitened that up. Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

You are a white Shriner. The black Shriner don't integrate the shrine. Why don't you black Shriners integrate the shrine? Because in the shrine, you are the essence of the secret. They don't want you there. They'll have to tell the world, it's you we been thinking about all along.

Now, white folks see the reason you could look at the O.J. Simpson trial, in horror, and the reason blacks folk rejoiced, had nothing to do with the horror of the tragedy. Black folk would never rejoice over the slaughter of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.

Black folk saw that with compassion. Many black folk grieve over that reality. You say, ""O.J. sold out."" No, he didn't sell out. He was drawn out.

Black folk that got talent, they all grow up in the ""hood."" When we first sing, we sing in these old raunchy night clubs in the ""hood.""

When we play sandlot ball, we play it in the ""hood."" But when you spot us, you draw us out. You say ""that Negro can run. Look at how high he jumps."" So you give us a scholarship to your university. But the blacks who are in college, who play basketball for you, who play football for you, who run track for you, you disallow them to get involved with black students and the suffering of black students on all white campuses. You hide them away. Give them privileges. Then they find themselves with your daughter.

Then you take them into the NBA, the NFL, and they become megastars. Or in the entertainment field and when they become megastars, their association is no longer black. They may not have a black manager, a black agent, a black accountant. They meet in parties, in posh neighborhoods that black folk don't come into. So their association becomes white women, white men, and association breeds assimilation. And if you have a slave mentality, you feel you have arrived now because you can jump over cars, running in airports, playing in films.

I'm not degrading, my brother, I love him. But he was drawn out. He didn't sell out, he was drawn out. Michael Jackson is drawn out. Most of our top stars are drawn out. And then, when you get them, you imprison them with fear and distrust. You don't want them to speak out on the issues that are political, that are social. They must shut their mouths or you threaten to take away their fame, take away their fortune because you're sick. And the president is not gonna point this out. He's trying to get well. But he's a physician that can't heal himself.

I'm almost finished. White supremacy has poisoned the bloodstream of religion, education, politics, jurisprudence, economics, social ethics and morality.

And there is no way that we can integrate into white supremacy and hold our dignity as human being because if we integrate into that, we become subservient to that. And to become subservient to that is to make the slave master comfortable with his slave. So, we got to come out of her my people. Come out of a system and a world that is built on the wrong idea. An idea that never can create a perfect union with God.

The false idea of white supremacy prevents anyone from becoming one with God. White people have to come out of that idea, which has poisoned them into a false attitude of superiority based on the color of their skins. The doctrine of white supremacy disallows whites to grow to their full potential. It forces White people to see themselves as the law or above the law. And that's why Furhman could say that he is like a god. See, he thinks like that, but that idea is pervasive in police departments across the country. And it's getting worse and not better because white supremacy is not being challenged.

And I say to all of us who are leaders, all of us who are preachers, we must not shrink from the responsibility of pointing our wrong, so that we can be comfortable and keep White people comfortable in their alienation from God. And so, white folks are having heart attacks today because their world is coming down. And if you look at the Asians, the Asians have the fastest growing economies in the world. The Asians are not saying, bashing white people. You don't find the Asians saying the white man is this, the white man is that, the white man is the other.

He don't talk like that. You know what he does? He just relocates the top banks from Wall Streets to Tokyo. He don't say, I'm better than the white man. He just starts building his world and building his economy and challenging white supremacy. I saw a young 14 year old Chinese girl the other day play the violin.

Sarah Chang is her name. She was magnificent. I saw a young Japanese girl, Midori, play the violin. She was magnificent. They don't have to say to white people, I'm better than you. They just do their thing. And white folk have to readjust their thinking, because they thought that they could master all of these instruments and nobody else could, but the Chinese are mastering it, the Japanese are mastering it. All these things are breaking up the mind of White supremacy.

Black man, you don't have to bash white people, all we gotta do is go back home and turn our communities into productive places. All we gotta do is go back home and make our communities a decent and safe place to live. And if we start dotting the Black community with businesses, opening up factories, challenging ourselves to be better than we are, White folk, instead of driving by, using the ""N"" word, they'll say, look, look at them. Oh, my God. They're marvelous. They're wonderful. We can't, we can't say they're inferior anymore. But, every time we drive by shoot, every time we carjack, every time we use foul, filthy language, every time we produce culturally degenerate films and tapes, putting a string in our women's backside and parading them before the world, every time we do things like this we are feeding the degenerate mind of white supremacy and I want us to stop feeding that mind and let that mind die a natural death.

And so, to all the artists that are present, you wonderful gifted artists, remember that your gift comes from God. And David the Psalmist said, praise him on the tumbrel, praise him on the lute, praise him on the harp, praise him in the sultry, praise in the song, praise him in the dance, let everything be a praise of God.

So, when you sing, you don't have to get naked to sing. Demonstrate your gift, not your breast. Demonstrate your gift, not what is between your legs. Clean up, Black man, and the world will respect and honor you. But, you have fallen down like the prodigal son and you're husking corn and feeding swine.

Filthy jokes. We can't bring our children to the television.

We can't bring our families to the movies because the American people have an appetite like a swine. And you are feeding the swine with the filth of degenerate culture. We got to stop it.

We're not putting you down, brothers, we want to pick you up so with your wrap, you can pick up the world. With your song, you can pick up the world. With your dance, with your music, you can pick up the world.

And so America, if your conscience is afflicted because God is lashing you, don't just start with the constitution, Mr. President. Start with the evil of slavery because that's the root of the problem.

And you can't solve the problem, Mr. President, unless we expose the root. For when you expose the root to the light, then the root will die. The tree will die. And something new can come to birth. And so to the whites of this nation, accept you be born again, you can not see the kingdom of God. But can I return back into my mother's womb for the second time? No. You can't do that. But this old mind of white supremacy has to die in order that a new mind might come to birth.

Black man. You can't see the kingdom of God unless we be born again. Must I enter back into my mother's womb for a second time? No. You can't do that black man. But the mind of white supremacy is repulsive to God. And the mind of black inferiority is repulsive to God. And any mind of black supremacy is repulsive to God. But the only mind that God will accept is a mind stayed on him and on righteousness.

Black had to be taught to give us root in loving ourselves again. But that was a medicine, a prescription. But after health is restored we can't keep taking the medicine. We've got to move onto something else. Higher and better.

So, my beloved brothers and sisters, here's what we would like you to do. Everyone of you, my dear brothers, when you go home, here's what I want you to do. We must belong to some organization that is working for and in the interest of the uplift and the liberation of our people.

Go back, join the NAACP if you want to, join the Urban league, join the All African People's Revolutionary Party, join us, join the Nation of Islam, join PUSH, join the Congress of Racial Equality, join SCLC - the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, but we must become a totally organized people and the only way we can do that is to become a part of some organization that is working for the uplift of our people.

We must keep the local organizing committees that made this event possible, we must keep them together. And then all of us, as leaders, must stay together and make the National African American Leadership Summit inclusive of all of us.

I know that the NAACP did not officially endorse this march. Neither did the Urban League. But, so what? So what? Many of the members are here anyway. I know that Dr. Lyons, of the National Baptist Association USA did not endorse the march, nor did the Reverend Dr. B.W. Smith, nor did Bishop Chandler Owens, but so what? These are our brothers and we're not going to stop reaching out for them simply because we feel there was a misunderstanding. We still want to talk to our brothers because we cannot let artificial barriers divide us. Remember the letter of Willie Lynch and let's not let Willie Lynch, lynch our new spirit and our new attitude and our new mind.

No, we must continue to reach out for those that have condemned this, and make them to see that this was not evil, it was not intended for evil, it intended for good. Now, brothers, moral and spiritual renewal is a necessity. Every one of you must go back home and join some church, synagogue or temple or mosque that is teaching spiritual and moral uplift. I want you, brothers, there's no men in the church, in the mosque.

The men are in the streets and we got to get back to the houses of God. But preachers we have to revive religion in America.

He have to revive the houses of God that they're not personal thiefdoms of those of us who are their preachers and pastors. But we got to be more like Jesus, more like Mohammed, more like Moses and become servants of the people in fulfilling their needs.

Brothers, when you go home, we've got to register eight million, eligible but unregistered brothers, sisters. So you go home and find eight more like yourself. You register and get them to register. I register as Democrat? Should I register as a Republican? Should I register as independent?

If you're an independent, that's fine. If you're a Democrat, that's fine. If you're a Republican, that's OK. Because in local elections you have to do that which is in the best interest of your local community. But what we want is not necessarily a third party, but a third force.

Which means that we're going to collect Democrats, Republicans and independents around an agenda that is in the best interest of our people. And then all of us can stand on that agenda and in 1996, whoever the standard bearer is for the Democratic, the Republican, or the independent party should one come into existence. They've got to speak to our agenda.

We're no longer going to vote for somebody just because they're black. We tried that. We wish we could. But we got to vote for you, if you are compatible with our agenda.

Now many of the people that's in this House right here are put there by the margin of the black vote. So in the next election, we want to see who's in here do we want to stay and who in here do we want to go.

And we want to show them that never again will they every disrespect the Black community. We must make them afraid to do evil to us and think they can get away with it.

We must be prepared to help them if they are with us or to punish them if they're against us. And when they are against us, I'm not talking about color. I'm talking about an agenda that's in the best interest of the Black, the poor and the vulnerable in this society.

Now atonement goes beyond us. I don't like this squabble with the members of the Jewish community. I don't like it. The honorable Elijah Muhammad said in one of his writing that he believed that we would work out some kind of an accord. Maybe so. Reverend Jackson has talked to the 12 presidents of Jewish organizations and perhaps in the light of what we see today, maybe it's time to sit down and talk. Not with any preconditions. You got pain. Well, we've got pain, too. You hurt. We hurt, too.

The question is: if the dialogue is proper then we might be able to end the pain. And ending the pain may be good for both and ultimately good for the nation. We're not opposed to sitting down. And I guess if you can sit down with Arafat where there are rivers of blood between you -- why can't you sit down with us and there's no blood between us. You don't make sense not to dialogue. It doesn't make sense.

Well, brothers, I hope Father Clemons spoke today. Is Father Clemons here? Do you know Father Clemons? He is one of the great pastors. Father Clemons, I wanted him to speak today because he has a program that he wants everyone of us when we leave here to go to some jail or prison and adapt one inmate for the rest of his and your life to make them your personal friend -- to help them through their incarceration, to be encouragement for them. The brothers who are locked down inside the walls need us on the outside and we need them on the inside. So if everyone of us will pick out one inmate, Father Clemons will do the work of guiding this development, because it is his idea, and it is a good idea and the national African-American leadership summit adapts that idea.

Thank you, Father Clemons. Will you do that, brothers?

How many of you will adopt one black man in prison and make him your pal, your brother for life. Help him through the incarceration. Well, go to the chaplain of that jail and say, you want to adopt one inmate. Start writing to that person, visiting that person, helping that person. And since so many of us have been there already, we know what they suffer. Let's help our brothers and sisters who are locked down.

Did anybody mention the political prisons? Brother Conrad Worrel mentioned our political prisoners, never forget them. And now, brothers, there are 25,000 black children in need of adoption. This is out brother Eason (ph) who is the President of Blacks in Government. I'm sorry, brother Dunston, the president of the black social workers. He has 25,000 children in need of adoption. Out of this vast audience, there must be 25,000 men who will take one of these children and take them through life and make life worth living for those children. In this vast audience, is there anyone one, two, ten, twenty-five, hundred, a thousand, 25 thousand who would be willing to adopt a black brother or sister, bring them into your home and rear them properly. How many of you think you would like to do that, would you just raise your hand, let me take a look. Raise them high. That's a wonderful expression. Where should they do, what should they do, who should they see.

UNKNOWN (FROM THE PODIUM): They should see booth 26 north.

Booth 26 north is where you should go. It is to my right, your left. Or you should call 1-800-419-1999. Now brothers, the last thing we want to say, we want to develop an economic development fund. Suppose, the nearly 2 million here, and 10 million more back home that support us gave ten dollars a month to a national economic development fund.

Inside of one month, we would have over $100 million. And in one year, we would have $1 billion, $200 million. What will we do with that? I would love for the leadership up here to form a board and call in Myrley Evers Williams and ask here, what is the budget of the NAACP for this year? It's $13 million. It's $15 million, write a check. Now, next year you have to become accountable to the board, and the members of the NAACP will be on the board too, which means that no Black organization will be accountable to anybody outside of us.

But accountable to us and we will free the NAACP, the Urban League and all Black organizations to work in the best interest of our people. How many of you would like to see all our Black organizations free? Now, look brothers, an economic development fund for $10 a month is not a big price to ask to begin to build an economic infrastructure to nurture businesses within the Black community. Soon the leadership is going to meet and work out the details of an Exodus, Exodus Economic Fund.

And we're going to get back to you. This is not a one day thing. A task force will be formed right out of this leadership to make sure that the things that we say today will be implemented so that next year of the day of atonement, which this will take place each and every year from now on until God says, well done. Now, you saw the money that was taken up today, didn't you? How many of you gave some money today? I see some hands that wanted to give, but didn't get that box to them.

Well, let me tell you something brothers, we want an outside accounting firm to come in and scrutinize every dollar that was raised from your pockets to make the Million Man March a success. And if there is any overage, it will not be spent. We will come back to this board of leadership and we will account for every nickel, every dime every dollar.

Do you know why? We want Willie Lynch to die a natural death. And the only way we can kill the idea of Willie Lynch, we have to build trust in each other.

And the only way we can build trust is to open up the coat and show that you don't have a hidden agenda. All of us will be looking at the same thing, for the same purpose.

And then we'll come back to you and make a full accounting for every nickel, every dime, and every dollar so that you can trust. I put my life on this. To rob you is a sin. To use you and abuse you is a sin. To make mockery of your love and your trust is a sin. And we repent of all sin and we refuse to do sin anymore.

Is that agreeable, black man. Now, brothers, I want you to take this pledge. When I say I, I want you to say I, and I'll say your name. I know that there's so many names, but I want you to shout your name out so that the ancestors can hear it.

Take this pledge with me. Say with me please, I, say your name, pledge that from this day forward I will strive to love my brother as I love myself. I, say your name, from this day forward will strive to improve myself spiritually, morally, mentally, socially, politically, and economically for the benefit of myself, my family, and my people. I, say your name, pledge that I will strive to build business, build houses, build hospitals, build factories, and then to enter international trade for the good of myself, my family, and my people. I, say your name, pledge that from this day forward I will never raise my hand with a knife or a gun to beat, cut, or shoot any member of my family or any human being, except in self-defense.

I, say your name, pledge from this day forward I will never abuse my wife by striking here, disrespecting her for she is the mother of my children and the producer of my future. I, say your name, pledge that from this day forward I will never engage in the abuse of children, little boys, or little girls for sexual gratification. But I will let them grow in peace to be strong men and women for the future of our people. I, say your name, will never again use the B word to describe my female, but particularly my own Black sister.

I, say your name, pledge from this day forward that I will not poison my body with drugs or that which is destructive to my health and my well being. I, say your name, pledge from this day forward, I will support Black newspapers, Black radio, Black television. I will support Black artists, who clean up their acts to show respect for themselves and respect for their people, and respect for the ears of the human family.

I, say your name, will do all of this so help me God. Well, I think we all should hold hands now. And I want somebody to sing ""To God be the Glory"".  And the reason I want this song sung is because I don't want anybody to take the credit for a day like this. I didn't do it. Reverend Chavis didn't do it. Reverend Jackson didn't do it. Reverend Sharpton didn't do it. Conrad Rawell in Manarana Karinga (ph) didn't do it. Dr. Cornell West didn't do it. But all of us worked together to do the best that we could but it's bigger than all of us.

So since we can't take the praise, then we have to give all the glory, all the honor, all the praise to him to whom it rightfully belongs. So in closing, we want to thank Mayor Barry and Mrs. Barry for opening this great city to us. And out of every dollar that was collected, ten percent of it we're going to leave here in Washington that Mayor Barry may aid some institution, some good cause in the city. We want to set a good example.

This was a beautiful and peaceful meeting. Probably one of the best that ever was held in Washington held by Black men who want to atone to God and clear our slate. Beautiful Black brothers. Beautiful brothers, I'm going to say a prayer and I want to thank Phi Beta Sigma and its wonderful, wonderful president and all the Greek letter organizations but Phi Beta Sigma especially because they opened their door to the Million Man March and made it possible. I want to thank the Reverend Dr. Benjamin Chavis who did a wonderful, wonderful job. I thank his wife for her sacrifice and my wife for hers. I thank Dorothy Height and the National Council of Negro Women. I thank Dr. Betty Shabazz who came in the name of her husband and I thank God for allowing the negative thing to be turned into a positive that she and I might start a process of reconciling 30 year old differences. Lord knows if we could do it with blood between us, God knows that Bloods and Crips have done it and whatever we have done to one another, don't let the sun set before saying to your brother, I love you and I'm sorry. And after the prayer is said and the song is sung, I want you all to just embrace each other and say to each other, I love you my brother and thank you for making this holy day of atonement real in my life.

Don't do it now, wait til after prayer and the song. Will you bow your heads, please? Oh, before we say that prayer, the brother of my leader and teacher, the honorable Elijah Muhammad, is here with me and with us. He's like my father in the absence of my father. He knows this history of the Nation of Islam better than any man in America and I thank God that he lived long enough to see the day that he suffered and worked for, for now 65 years. The brother of the honorable Elijah Muhammad, brother John Muhammad.

(APPLAUSE)

And so now ...

MUHAMMAD: Dar Selim Eloahim! (PH)

Dar Eloahim Salaam (PH). He looks just like my daddy! And oh, Reverend Jackson, where is that great man? He had to go! Didn't he preach today? And now, with your heads bowed, (SINGS IN ARABIC)

In the name of Allah the beneficent, the merciful, praise be to Allah the Lord of the world, the beneficent, the merciful master of the day of requital.

Thee do we worship. Thine aid we seek. Guide us on the right path. The path of those upon whom you have bestowed favors, not the path of those upon whom wrath is brought down. Nor those who go astray. Oh, Allah. We thank you for this holy day of Atonement and Reconciliation.

We thank you for putting your spirit and your calm in Washington, D.C. and over the heads of this nearly two million of your servants. We thank you for letting us set a new example, not only for our people but for America and the world.

We thank you, oh, Allah, for bringing us safely over the highways and we beg you to bring us safely back to our wives and our children and our loved ones, who saw us off earlier or a few days ago.

And as we leave this place, let us be resolved to go home to work out this Atonement and make our communities a decent, whole, and safe place to live. And oh, Allah, we beg your blessings on all who participated, all who came that presented their bodies as a living sacrifice, wholly and acceptable as their reasonable service.

Now, let us not be conformed to this world, but let us go home transformed by the renewing of our minds and let the idea of atonement ring throughout America.

That America may see that the slave has come up with power. The slave is been restored, delivered, and redeemed. And now call this

nation to repentance. To acknowledge her wrongs. To confess, not in secret documents, called classified, but to come before the world and the American people as the Japanese prime minister did and confess her faults before the world because her sins have affected the whole world. And perhaps, she may do some act of atonement, that you may forgive and those ill-affected may forgive, that reconciliation and restoration may lead us to the perfect union with thee and with each other. We ask all of this in your Holy and Righteous Name, Allah, akbar (PRAYER IN ARABIC). Allah, akbar. Allah, akbar. That means God is great.
And now Gregory Hopkins to sing To God Be the Glory. Keep holding each other's hands, brothers. And after the song is sung, let us embrace each other.

(PERFORMANCE OF SONG)

Turn to your brother and hug your brother and tell your brother you love him and let's carry this love all the way back to our cities and towns and never let it die, brothers. Never let it die.3Embed"

Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks on him (Shoop)

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men

Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)

(And you know)
It's like that and a, a Hieroglyphics, yeah

(together) Hiero, y'all...

[Verse 1: A-Plus]
It's not a wrong thing
To be addicted to the microphone like a heron fiend
I'll tell you one thing:
You'll never catch me fronting
As I proceed to give the people what they wanting
You're making some green...
But not for glamour or fashion
I'm stacking cash until I can get Moms a mansion
All from rapping?
Nah, man, there's many plans
Like investing in land
It started all from impressing the fans
With brand new flows
And you know
All the way from gangsta clones to weirdos
Fools used those
But we ain't tripping
Give respect when you see this
You need us
Or your rhymes underdeveloped like a fetus
You might also like[Verse 2: Pep Love]
Those that know not doze
And it shows
When we broke out the knock
Hoes hopped out they clothes
That's positive feedback
Yep, The Prose
I'm poised, we never pose, you'll never know
From '93 til infinity we've been inventive
Creating the bump is our only incentive
And it's been a long time since I feel I've been felt
But the only thing I fear is fear itself
So you know what we gots to do
Maybe could we keep it within the crew
Like it should be?
Never givin' out
We're livin' out our dreams
If there's something I can't live without
That's my team
You never knew...

[Verse 3: Phesto]
Hieroglyphics
Hip-hop is vintage
Underground like silos
Launching long-range ballistics
World-renowned, we ground-breaking
Musical boundaries
Runnin' circles around emcees
(You never knew)
It's like that and a, a Hieroglyphics, yeah
(And you know)
It's like that and a, a Hieroglyphics, yeah
(You never knew)

(And you know)
It's like that and a, a Hieroglyphics, yeah
It's like...

[Verse 4: Del]
Del, been rhyming for more than a decade
Onto the next stage, while emcees need aid
Stay paid, I'm still grade-A
None of that tomfoolery
As you can see this shit ain't nothing new to me
Utterly hovering over other things material
You're stuck in the here and now
Plus you're sweating profusely, here's a towel
Your fears are now reality
When I take your dream states
And elaborate on how your team's fake
Like phony IDs, but sometimes I feel like
Only I see through the charade you've made
In today, but hey, tomorrow it's played
And then they got a new fool in your place to be okayed
[Verse 5: Tajai]
Hieroglyphics
Hip-hop is vintage
Invented in days back
Rekindling in ways that many thought was lost
In this contemporary maze of methods to floss
We finding trees and trails to blaze
Boundaries to cross
We can be found beyond the bounds of reason
Or earthbound, heatin' up the Coliseum

[Verse 6: Opio]
They rushed the stage full-throttle in Chicago
Our brains interlocked
Where fakin' emcees get caught with the 40-bottle
Or get their chains snatched, pronto
We unstoppable, droppin' flows in Toronto
Maneuverin' through Vancouver and on to Japan
Where they put major grands in my hand
Follow...

[Verse 7: Phesto]
Straight from the heart we set apart from the rest an'
Our perfection on the microphone was predestined
World-renowned, we ground-breaking
Musical boundaries
Runnin' circles around emcees

I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

[Verse 1: Speech]
See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'
Investigation maybe she was demonstratin'
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route
Disrespectin' my black queen
Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and yes, they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (Boom!)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissin' it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me

I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube (Who?)
But I had to take the brother out for bein' rude (Hey!)
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story, y'all, of a black man
Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see

[Intro: 2Pac]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty
Uh, feel me!
(Come with me; Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
Much too hardened for a smile, way too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Bail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

[Verse 3: Kastro]
They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up
[Bridge: Kadafi]
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

[Chorus: 2Pac & Prince Ital Joe]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary (Hail Mary)
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary!

Said, I gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta (They will always haunt my dreams)
Pick up the pieces and master the puzzle upon us (The green twins with your eyes)
Look the man in the mirror in the eye and be honest
Slow down time, get back in line with my chakras (They will always haunt my dreams)
Reach for the galaxy
Leave stardust for thus after me (The green twins with your eyes)
Enter the void, fill in the cavity
Risk the reward if that's how it has to be (They will always haunt my dreams)
I gotta do better, I gotta do better, I gotta do
Everything in my power to try to do what God would do (The green twins with your eyes)
Ride the tide, don't fight with the current that guided you
Melt the ice round the furnace burnin' inside you (They will always haunt my dreams)

Shades stuck to my face, hoodie glued to my head (They will always haunt my dreams)
Hidin' from the same world that made me who I am (The green twins with your eyes)
Depressed, can't even get out of bed
Too blessed to be so stressed (They will always haunt my dreams)
I do all this shit, just to say, ""Get off my dick""
Mixed emotions prohibit my focus (The green twins with your eyes)
This what you wanted, what's wrong with you? You don't make sense
Feel like I can flip at any moment (They will always haunt my dreams)
Faces playin' and it's fuckin' with me
“Doin' drugs was just a war with boredom, but it's sure to get me”, Lord forgive me
(The green twins with your eyes) Amen
Wear the crown of thorns for sport, I'm just waitin' for a stone to hit me
(They will always haunt my dreams) Uh
Relationship on the rocks, my family all concerned (The green twins with your eyes)
My homie still on the block, gettin' it off the curb
I'm stricken by survivor's guilt, I'm gettin' it off of words

Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then, man we thought we growed up
Rushin' out of kid just to be grown up

[Chorus]
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Yeah, whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

[Verse 2]
I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills, got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man, they wetter than the Everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Niggas catch a heart attack
Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

Coli ft. Earl Sweatshirt (Tradução em Português) Lyrics[Intro]
Você vê as músicas, elas são-
É o que eu faço
Apenas escrevo as músicas e as canto
Portanto, é puro sentimento
É completa honestidade
Se você puder localizar a origem do seu medo, ele desaparecerá

[Verso]
Meus pensamentos, sonhos, tramas, e meus esquemas
Isso é o que tá na minha cabeça quando eu me deito pra dormir
Meu coração é igual a minha caneta quando eu escrevo e sangra
Meu carrinho tá cheio de pecados, quando eu faço compras é uma farra
Eu tenho algumas folhas novas
Eu fico tipo ""Qual é a sua palavra, senhor?""
Você acabou de jogar musgo numa árvore, eu não tô preocupado com você
Eu saio do meio-fio quando tô atravessando a rua
Eu tô tomando cuidado com a marca da besta
O distintivo do policial, calça preta de carpinteiro
15 gramas neles, mais 15 gramas na minha lã
E por causa disso, vá em frente e me deixe fora disso
Eu tô lá fora com a brisa
Eu tô me esquivando do condado, está a mil graus
É uma coisa de beco, meu mano, se liga
Meus olhos estão bem abertos, eu tô com sono, tô numa rodovia
Paul Giamatti, o mano tava sentado de lado
Uma bolha e um Skully ao viajar pelo Tri-state
E o problema é pegar a arma, ouvi-la atirar e fazer minha mente disparar
Pra frente e pra trás, eu tô em quarto lugar, mantenha sua tocha
Tô com seus pedaços no meu prato, filho da puta
Eu não nasci, minha mãe me tirou da porra da cegonha na Sexta-Feira
Diga essa merda na minha cara

A breeze brushes out of my mouth
Nautical miles ahead of the north star
It flys skys of
Canvases of silence stain
Inking the vase of yo brain
Pellets through pallets of time

Pain with colors of thoughts
Murmurs noted together feathers of letters
On the birds of my words
Surds unrootable noddin' floatin' flyin'
Into the paper
Taper choking emptiness Poison Pen
And Poisonous poets

Reveal, the Common pen while
I'm penning huriye kalimate
On to yo brain like Janaid Atlaf
Quiet carefully, like a grandma makin'
Tarts sweet like Mavado
More fragile than Lupe

Preventin' a fiasco like you retards
Mirrorin' Wiz Khalifa

A new start art lookin'
Out yo window wailing wadding wadis
Of wishes
Like a non-materialistic widow in MC Kash's piece

Through the peace of materialism sparks a
Fo-fo for freedom forming filtering of
The sponge with dungeons of photons
Allowing the sun rise above into yo eyes
Ice, ice-cold cold carefully crafted calculatedly
Out of the windows of my words like Dead Prez

Presidential posh hip-hop delicacy
On the platter of silence lens Killah Pirest's
Words

MyVerse so warm, that I freeze yo ears
And eyes, 6 n the morning like ice-t and ice-cube
Jus to shine in the flashlight of the
5th element of hip hop from the rage against the machine
Floating through Tech N9ne into a sniper, Public Enemy

The rap olympics, E-ric B and Rakim in MC Square
In the toilet, my
Mind don't mine Playboy magazines
Focused like KRS
The only one that mines the magazines
Reading out anarchy in XP with
X-rays of x-thoughts
Ass liberation, filling in feeding my rhyme
Like Krazy Race racin rime chime in real
Time flakes. Flicks
In steal that can be shared but not
Sold like Chali 2na

Fishy capitalists niggas altering
To alter me to the dow jones, altar like Viper Records
Slithering main line of lions
Lionized revolutionaries in hip hoppers
Hard, to enter the center
Of his attic underneath
Neatly his mane, Hasan Salaam
Man, he not cold
But still won't fold and
Mold
And ass to our colors

Turfs of lyrical nerds
Disheartening, he hurt us
Pulls out bulls of earthing red pills
Loud Killer Mike like Ill Bill
Sick, Ill Citizen passport breeding
Martyrs and revolutionaries and lyricists
A stable staple complex carbohydrate
Kam, but no Kim
No Kanye West ass Kweli, Talib Kweli
And Mos Def connection, a Black Star
Like Westside Connection
A Klishnikov like Fred Hampton

Original male, melody for our blinding
Malady like Crooked I
Infectious vaccination, tall E.T like
Tall Paul. Paris style Styles of Beyond
No faggots in his mind like Vinnie Paz
Sauce cutting sweet taste, large tasters like Chino XL

Professor Griff, wat grief
His eyes don't animate
On Christmas. No Nicki Minaj
Ho ho ho down the chimney
Cannot use his piece of a lap dancin' theme song

Need to control his ass, no thongs
Yeah, eyes like Che
A demon caring Welfare Poet
Givin' me a headache like pumpkinhead
In the waves

No radio like Radio Rahim, all day
Rebeal diaz, break the star like Breaksar
No profits made form his brain
Like Imam Husain
Through our chambers

Physicists, monkeyin' over kinematics
Lost in a mirage right above like Fatima
Poeticized speech prophet caged immune from d-grades
Like sidegrave like Maqbool Bhat

Bad armored thoughts, Agent of Change
Chanin' the environment like Marcus Garvey
Like a knight
Through the night
Blurs through Robin Hood
Through the hood

Mist missed the moon
Blurs ashamed running' on Highway 61
Act 61 like Chuck D in rites niggas like you
Write more than a psycho

Lynchin' daily X on the KKK
Cross the burnin' cross
I reply, I write daily like its my rite
No UN necessary like I'm Sisi
Smile, with rap rhetoric censoring o more moors
I'm Big Daddy Kane

The elite, utopia delighted to put an X
On my name, professionally like I'm Malcolm or Jasiri
Cause I be a be buzzin' in they
Orchard chart of my heart, Zayd Malik like Mohammd Muneem

Past due my birthday
Be Jashn-e-azadi, for various niggas
Yeah, yai hai khun hai shahida cause

We got 2 work together like Ant Lok
Use your Logic to see its relative
Lowkey, A Tribe called Quest

When worst comes 2 worst
Words be right there checklist
Writ in alarm clock music
For inspiration nation

Cradles of civilizations heart hurt
Under the earth. Like the factions of
Slayers of 2Pac's heart
Dey, got heart stoppers to close the door of conscious

But asses couldn't wipe out lyricism
Stopper from the floor of
Hip hop hoping the hope
In hip-hopin hops like Scott La Rock's voice

Noise sops the tears
Dam, my words a ward to the oppressed
Yet still sharp shaft shin in'
Into yo eyes

Cold they said good niggas
Die young than I bleed blood
Than 2Pac's age is where I lay at

Drunk from y rhymes
Into the waves like the bedouins with Muhammad
Smugglin' rings of sound to
Yo ears underground song like aadvard

Renegade Viet Cong tunnelin'
Mind arms like octopus's hands
The Immortal Technique like Guerrilla Warfare
Shared mechanically stressed the stubble
Travels marxed through linen like a Keinan
Through the mind beats like Sun Tzu

Son, like my mind engaged my gage
Knits itself into reality like Morphius
Beyonce and Jay-Z out of the gluteus maximus of
Illusion like a red pill
Bills fill my mind with death
Neva possible my down fall on the
Waterfall of life that
Be impossible like me getting sidetracked
To the sidetracks of life

Ok, a última vez que tentamos isso, não acabou bem
Além disso, você nunca sabe a história que os amigos contam
E bêbado de licor marrom, eu me sinto como o Denzel
Em Washington, em D.C. com uma vadia da cor de chocolate
Essa vadia maluca fica chapada de drogas eróticas
Então, o que você faz? Atiro no clube igual o Stojakovic
Cara, essa é a outra merda
Pagando pensão alimentícia através do governo
Finais de semana de custódia conjunta, você não pode tocar na criança
Cara, amo essa vadia
Vamos viajar e preencher a lista de desejos
Ter cerca de dez filhos no rancho em algum lugar do sul
Você quer dizer, coisa de otário
Você é escravo da buceta desde que você descobriu o que era
Dez mil pela bolsa da Chanel, isso é orçamento ruim
Além disso, esses caras estão sempre juntos, é muito sufocante
Você vive atrás das vadias, eu nunca pensei que chegaria a isso
Por que você tá sempre bravo? Eu só quero me divertir com isso

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)

'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now, this looks like a job for me

Le mot ""hardcore"" passe de l'euphémisme à euphorie

Leurs rêves deviennent cauchemars depuis qu'Sifoor a cané Morphée

I got some needs, I need the money like I need to breathe
I need the hundreds, a lot of
Tell that lil' bitch I'm out of her league
Out of her league
Yeah, Joyner
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
I got some needs, I need the money like I need to breathe
I needs some hundreds and I need to scheme
I need the W by any means, yadada
Yadada mean, tell that lil' bitch that I'm out of her league
Enough is enough and I think I'm allergic to suckers, you niggas keep makin' me sneeze
If thеm out for blood, then I'm makin' them bleed
You try to run and I'm breakin' your knees
I madе 'em fall like I'm rakin' the leaves
You know I ball like I play for the league
I mean what I say and I say what I mean
I ain't no joke, we ain't makin' no memes
If I pull up on 'em, I'm makin' a scene
Boom-boom-boom, then I'm makin' 'em scream
Straight from the bricks, I need a lick
I dreamed about it since I was a jit
Nigga, I'm lit, I cannot miss
Came from the bottom and got me a check
Bitch, I'm a threat, I gotta flex
You want the crown, but don't know what it takes
I am built different, I'm not what you think
I cannot lose, I'll go out with a bang
I hope you never say my name in vain
I'm with whatever, just not play no games
I know they say I changed, I cannot say the same
I bet they want me shackled and locked in the chains
I guess that's just what happens with bad news
On my mama, I've never been fragile
I'm the wrong one to fuck with, it's taboo
Turn you niggas to R.I.P. tattoos
Still a youngin but feel like a OG
Can't forget all the shit that they told me
Tired of niggas thinkin' that they know me
You gon' turn me back into the old me
You gon' turn me back into a savage
I done did shit you couldn't imagine
Leveled up and then bought me a mansion
I can never go back to a has-been

I can never go back to the old days, no way
Back to walkin' to work on a cold day
Back to thinkin' my ex was my soulmate
Back to tellin' myself, ""We'll be okay"", we'll be okay
Was survivin' off ramen and OJ
Shorty payin' the bills, I had no say
I can never go back to the bottom, to the bottom
Sellin' drugs, never know when the cops come
Niggas jealous, they wanted to rob us
I was just trying to get me some dollars, a couple dollars
Turned my pennies from hundreds to commas
I'm so happy them days are behind us

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I ride by different spots, I get flashbacks
I can't get on your level, I'm past that
Watch me run that shit up, I can't go back to nothin', trying to get to the top of the world
My nigga went crazy, he walked in his condo and seen someone fuckin' his girl (Girl)
Fuck all that spinnin' blocks, that's that lil' boy shit, we catch him, we rockin' his world (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
I let everybody have they fun with me
Never had a woman say she done with me
I was workin', now I own the company
I keep money coming in constantly
My lil' brodie and them be having Runtz for cheap
Trying to get it, I've been on the run for weeks
I don't think none of you niggas could come for me
Both of my kids got it honestly
I'm the real deal
All the way, I don't half-step
Gotta do better than last year, that's my motto
Put a switch on the blick, fully auto
Put them thangs on the plane like I'm Ralo
Proud to say that I've finally changed up
Why the fuck they keep bringin' my name up? 'Cause I'm poppin'
[Chorus: Lil Baby & Joyner Lucas]
I can never go back to the old days, no way
Back to walkin' to work on a cold day
Back to thinkin' my ex was my soulmate
Back to tellin' myself, ""We'll be okay"", we'll be okay
Was survivin' off of ramen and OJ

I'm so happy them days are behind me
I'm so happy the paper done found me
I done keep some good niggas around me
I got rid of them niggas who doubt me
Keepin' good energy and I'm prayed up

Once you cross me, ain't nothing can save you

[Intro: Just Blaze]
Hey!
It's coming
Ladies and gentlemen; this time around
The revolution will not be televised, woo!
As we proceed!, To give you what you need!
'09, brother!, Get live, brother!
Ladies and gentlemen of the court
In the hearing against The State of Hip-Hop vs. Jay Electronica
I present: Exhibit C

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica & Just Blaze]
When I was sleepin' on the train
Sleepin' on Meserole Ave out in the rain
Without even a single slice of pizza to my name
Too proud to beg for change, mastering the pain
When New York niggas was calling southern rappers lame
But then jacking our slang (Oh!)
I used to get dizzy spells, hear a little ring
The voice of an angel telling me my name
Telling me that one day I'ma be a great mane
Transforming with the Megatron Don, spittin' out flames (Oh!)
Eating wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains (Woo!)
I ain't believe it then; nigga, I was homeless (Uh huh)
Fightin', shootin' dice, smokin' weed on the corners
Trying to find the meaning of life in a Corona
'Til the Five Percenters rolled up on a nigga and informed him:
""You either build or destroy, where you come from?""
""The Magnolia projects in the 3rd Ward slum""
""Hmm, it's quite amazing that you rhyme how you do
And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru"" (Ooh!)
Question Fourteen, Muslim Lesson Two:
Dip-dive-uh, civilize a eighty-five-uh
I make the devil hit his knees and say the ""Our Father""
Abracadabra, you rocking with the true and living
Shout out to Lights Out, Joseph I, Chewy Bivens
Shout out to Baltimore, Baton Rouge, my crew in Richmond
While y'all debated who the truth was like Jews and Christians
I was on Cecil B., Broad Street, Master
North Philly, South Philly, 23rd, Tasker
Six Mile, Seven Mile, Hartwell, Gratiot (Oh!)
Where niggas really would pack a U-Haul truck up
Put the high beams on, drive up on the curb
At a barbecue and hop up out the back like, ""What's up?"" (Buh!)
Kill a nigga, rob a nigga, take a nigga, bust up
That's why when you talk the tough talk, I never feel you
You sound real good and you play the part well
But the energy you givin' off is so unfamiliar
I don't feel ya (We need somethin' realer! Ooh!)

""When you gon' drop that verse? Nigga, you taking long""
So now I'm back spittin' that heat, could pass a polygraph
That Reverend Run rockin' Adidas out on Hollis Ave
That FOI, Marcus Garvey, Nikky Tesla
I shock you like an eel, electric feel, Jay Electra
Oh my God! Keep going!
[Verse 3: Jay Electronica & Just Blaze]
They call me Jay Electronica—fuck that
Call me Jay Elec-Hanukkah, Jay Elec-Yarmulke
Jay Elect-Ramadan, Muhammad as-salaam-alaikum
RasoulAllah Subhanahu wa ta'ala through your monitor (Ooh!)
My Uzi still weigh a ton; check the barometer
I'm hotter than the motherfucking sun; check the thermometer
I'm bringing ancient mathematics back to modern man
My mama told me, ""Never throw a stone and hide your hand""
I got a lot of family, you got a lot of fans
That's why the people got my back like the Verizon man
I play the back and fade to black, and then devise a plan
Out in London, smoking, vibing while I ride the tram
Giving out that raw food to lions disguised as lambs
And—by the time they get they seats hot
And deploy all they henchmen to come at me from the treetops
I'm chillin' out at Tweetstock, building by the millions
My light is brilliant
[Outro: Just Blaze]
Woooo!
I rest my case
'09, Act 3
First chapter of the end
The last chapter of a new beginning
If it's so
The things we do without even trying...
Be better than a lot of y'all records, don't get mad
Morning after, world premiere
Me!
For real, though?
I ain't even gon' say nothing
Matter of fact; I ain’t saying—
I don't even know why I'm sayin’ this
Jay, you should get Puff to do this over
We moving out, onto the next record
And, um, I'ma let this just ride

F29 is my address, in case you ain't heard
It's floodin' upstairs, it's a leak
I don't make it squeak, make it squirt
I make this shit beat, bon appétit when I feast
Slippin' and slide through the streets
It takes a finesse, especially in this Cabriolet Jeep
Engine make it hard to creep
Just leave the gate open, through the side door, I'ma creep (Ooh, ooh)
Are you by the Turrell? And are the kids downstairs asleep?
And are you upstairs by yourself? A minute from there
Is there some room for me? Baby, do tell, do tell
[Chorus]
Tell me, is you still up? (Up)
It's 5 AM and I'm drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck? (Fuck that shit)
One of one, I'm in the zone right now
Tell me, am I still? (Mm)
Tellin' you just how I feel right now
You said it's just the drugs and I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lied too, way before (Let's go), before
Before I had you right inside my arms
But then again, I could be drunk20Embed"

This is easy perks
Photoshoot, stepped out of the chopper

Manolo boots keep cussin' at the hustlers
How you gon' get loot, you're cussin' out the customers
No sales, you better have my cash
If the feds don't grab me, I got lots of plans
I'll need goals, the all-star cast

Run to him or run from him
He's a killer so you can't take his gun from him
He bagged coke so his hands feel numb from him
He's a cold-hearted bastard, better dumb dumb him

[Part 1: Drake]
Ey, ich habe immer noch etwas Liebe tief in mir
Du brauchst mich nicht anzulügen, ich weiß, dass du einen Typen hast
Er ist kein Kerl für mich
Verabschiede dich einfach von ihm, dann nimm die Fahrt zu mir, fahr zu mir
Ich habe immer noch etwas Liebe tief in mir
Bitte zieh sie aus mir heraus
Du könntest einfach
Könntest du vielleicht den G-Wagen aus mir herausholen
Bitte holt es aus mir raus, bitte holt es raus
Rollie-Gang, Patty-Gang, Rich-Baby-Daddy-Gang
Ich bin mit Red, als wäre ich bei einem Cincinnati-Spiel
Hood-Bitch, tätowiert ihre Gang, bevor sie ihren Namen tätowiert
Echte Schlampe, die mich festhielt, bevor ich einen Namen hatte
Hörte, dass Geld auf mich ausgesetzt ist, was geht mich das an?
Ich setzte hundert Tauis auf ihn, er setzte einen Taui auf mich
Wir kommen aus zwei verschiedenen Welten, aber für mich ist es ein Spiel
Das einzige Mal, dass sie mir den Rücken zudreht, ist, dass sie sich umdreht (Auf ernst)

Du warst so gut und du verdienst es, dein Leiden zu beenden
Ich brauche einen Schwanz und ein Gespräch, kannst du mich trösten?
Ich habe das Gefühl, dass dies mehr ist als das, was wir beide sagen würden
Ich habe das Gefühl, das ist mehr als ein Gefühl
Ich kann dich nicht entkommen lassen
Fühlt sich gut an, aber es kann keine Liebe sein
Es gibt nichts, was ich tun würde
Es gibt nichts, oh

Ich mache ihn verrückt, er kann mich nicht allein lassen

Dreißig Zentimeter bis zu meinem Hintern

Du kennst die Wurzel davon
Du kennst die Lügen und du kennst die Wahrheit davon
Ich sehe die Zukunft und ich kann dich darin sehen
Mädchen, ich bin nicht dumm, also mach keine Dummheiten
Ich schwöre, mein Zeug zu rauchen, hat Konsequenzen
Post Nut Clarity, ich kam zur Besinnung
Ich wusste, dass es Liebe war, als es mit einer Freundschaft begann
Frage nach einem Baby, wir sollten vielleicht einen Frenchie holen
Und uns um den Hund kümmern
Um den Hund kümmern
Bis die Hundetage vorbei sind
Die Hundetage sind vorbei
Und du weißt, ich bin der Richtige, ich bin der Richtige
Die Hundetage sind vorbei, die Hundetage sind vorbei
Und du weißt, ich bin—

[Outro: Drake]
Wir haben Nacht für Nacht gefickt, ich werde dein Leben verändern
Du weißt nicht mal, wie man richtig bläst, ich hab's dir beigebracht
Du hast nicht mal von Grace Bay gehört, bis ich den Flug gekauft habe
Du wusstest nicht mal, wie kalt du warst, bis ich dir Ice kaufte
Du kannst ihn nicht einmal gleich ansehen, wir sind ein verschiedener Typ
Du schickst mir eine ungewöhnliche SMS, ich antworte: „Guten Flug!“
Willst für die Fahrt hier bleiben, Baby, halt dich gut festEmbed"

Makes me say, ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me

You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move outta yo' seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on

That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo' hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Up and early for the hope of a brand new day
See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day
Fresh haircut fitted with a fat-ass fade
End of work, we chilling on a Saturday
How you felt when you first heard the Daddy Kane
Rakim, KRS - hey I had that tape
Cooling out with ol' girl on a fat-ass date
Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great
Get promoted at your job up to management
Plot a long time finally a plan has made it
Sometimes I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way

How your team felt winning championship games
Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain
Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen
Put in hard work finally you're living your dream
Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes
Blind man gain his sight see his first sunrise
Young man speaking out, now he's loud and clear
Birthin' your child, smile so proud you wear
Going in your third eye for the styles you hear
Making music that'll bump for a thousand years
Eating right feeling conscious like health is first
Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work

When I'm gone, more likely that you notice me
In the dark it's more likely that you notice light
In the light more likely that you notice night
Hungry, more appreciation for that meal
Dead broke, more appreciation for that scrill
A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good
And that'll make things a little better understood

Now, I'm just having fun in the moment
And you been asking around for intrigue, (Oh no)
But the answers you get don't defend me
You shouldn’t play with if’s  and maybe’s
(Cause when your around baby) I Can’t Breathe!
You listen to things that they been mentioning
Come to me and I can fill you in
Cause you can’t rely on all the things they tell you (they tell you, they tell you)
Cause thеy don’t know what i don’t say (How could they know it)
You wanna know if where wе’re at is a usual space (Cause we both know that)
Cause we both know it ain't their place (And you know you can always reach me)
And even though we strong but I doubt, you ask around, I'm right here (I'm right here)
So maybe then the truth can be found
If you just allow yourself to see it (Tell me you can see it)
I guess you give me reason of doubt

I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because these

And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
'Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh,) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo Em! You got somethin' to say? Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up, and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever! I swear, man!

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow, they know
That I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead
Singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof, Eminem & Kon Artis]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold-out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo, wh—) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get ninety, and we only get ten percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?
[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

[Bridge: Eminem, Bizarre, Bizarre & Eminem]
Girl, why can't you (Roxanne, Roxanne)
See you're the (Bizarre will be your man)
Only one for me?
And it just
Tears my ass apart
To know that
You don't know my
Name! Man, fuck this

[Chorus: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the
Name of my band (Haha)
But they're all on me like they
Wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
'Cause once I blow, I know that
I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the new
*Blends* *Laughs*

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & Bizarre]
My band, my band (Your band)
My band, my band (Our band, your band)
My band, my band (You man, you man)
My band, my band (Roxanne Shanté)
My band (Lesbian)
Yeah, ayo
The hardest boy band in the world
D12!
[Outro: Eminem]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, woah, woah
Look out for my next single, it's called
""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants

[Verse 1: A Plus]
It's called the rump shaker, the beats is like sweeter than candy
I'm feelin' manly and your shaker's comin' in handy
Slide down my cloth from New York down by your Virginia
Ticklin' you around Delaware before I enter
Turn to seduction from face, hips to feet
A wiggle and a jiggle can make the night complete
Now since you've got the body of the year, come and get the award
Here's a hint, it's like a long sharp sword
Flip tail, so let me see you shake it up like dice
The way you shake your rump is turnin' mighty men to mice
But A Plus got a surprise that's a back breaker
Now let me see you shake your rump like a rump shaker

Yup, yup, it's Teddy, ready with the one-two checker
Wreckx-N-Effect is in effects, but I'm the wrecker
Of the track 'bout the honey shakin' rumps and they backs in
Booties of the cuties steady shakin' but relaxin'
The action is packed in a jam like a closet
Beats bound to get you up, cold flowin' like a faucet
Not mean to make you sit, not mean to make you jump
But, yep, make the hotties in the party shake your rump
I like the way you comb your hair (Uh)
I like the stylish clothes you wear (Uh)
It's just the little things you do (Uh)

[Verse 3: Markell Riley]
Shake it, shake it, shake it, now shake it
She can spend every birthday butt-naked
Body is soft, makin' me wanna squish her
More chest than the game, a rumper like a sub-woofer
Shake it to the left (Shake it), shake it to the right
I don't mind stickin' it to her every single night
Come on, pass the pum pum, send it to papa
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it, don't stoppa
Let me see you do the booty hop (Hop)
And now make the booty stop, now drop and do the booty wop (Ooh)
The way you shakin' your reals really kill
Is makin' broth-ills up a whole lotta bills
But I ain't into trickin', just to treatin'
And I ain't into treatin' every trick that I'm meetin'
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse One]
Free the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss
Unit in the stash the beats and never found the shit
Experience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched
Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch
In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it
I'mma give it, as far as you can take it
Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny
Many can find it but few can climb it
I'm open-minded like a pothead
Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed
In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls
Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle
I bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers
The world is bitter, like baby mothers
Look how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us
Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God

Everywhere is broken glass
Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass
Try not to say shoot around my daughter, she already know the blast
Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past
It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon
Niggas is fake like bitches braggin
Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion
In motion like cars
I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars
The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours
Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies
Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me
(.. from a distance) niggas tried to appraise me
I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me
My days be spent, behind dream's tent
Through the sun the divine being is sent
It's the Sun God

[Verse Three]
Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion
I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position
I can't crystalize the mission lies within
Born to die even in death we begin
It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know
And carry low swing on a chariot slow
Brothers stick though remindin me of revolution
If the drama comes I'mma have to up Papa's gun

Let's do it

[Verse 1]
Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride , went to a club, was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king?""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing""

[Hook]
Wild thing
Wild thing

[Verse 2]
Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night?""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

[Verse 3]
Posse in effect, hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame, I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when bodies start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

[Hook]
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing

[Verse 4]
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She wanted to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, ""Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing""
[Outro]
Say what?
Yo love, you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista, baby

Yeah, I want y'all to listen
Question

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch? (aww)
Know everything, but don't know shit (aww)
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith (aww)
I just turn my music up like 'Damn that's some cold shit' (aww)
I mighta known her 'bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke?
He said 'You lying yo, why is you lying yo?'
Cut it out, quit it G, you hurting my kid-i-neys
Naw, she talking bout a couple of kids for me (aww)
She's hinting at a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treating fat hoes differently
You might also like[Hook: Kanye West]
Aww, I see now
You was hurt and you on the rebound (aww)
Ben & Jerry's and Mickey D's now
And you just gone gain all that weight on me now (naw)
Naw (naw), fall back
If I ain't a player then what the hell you call that?
A nigga disrespect me I'mma be in all black
But baby if you let me I'mma take it all back

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh & Consequence]
I write verses, do shows for a living
Hoes, they look at me like every day Thanksgiving
Peep, check how I'm living, white T's, free jeans
Shotgun and Capri's, big height like Yao Ming
And it seems the style then how they go out they way
Just to prove they dedicated and devoted to Ray
I guess it goes how they say, that that pimp will repay
That's why I put 'em to the test like every day
Not like the G.E.D. or an S.A.T
Pop quiz, let 'em know that they meal ain't free
It's on like a college degree when you following me
Without the entry level job there's a modelling fee
So when I tell you 'Get 'em girl' and you prove that you true
I let you bolt up on the block with the rest of the crew
This just a couple of trials that we put 'em through
Let a nigga know now what you tryna do, for real
[Hook: Kanye West]
Aww, I see now
You was hurt and you on the rebound (aww)
Ben & Jerry's and Mickey D's now
And you just gone gain all that weight on me now (naw)
Naw (naw), fall back
If I ain't a player then what the hell you call that?
A nigga disrespect me I'mma be in all black
But baby if you let me I'mma take it all back

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Phonte the five star syllablist, females
I hit 'em with deliberate styles for me to try to lay with them
And then chill around the way with them
Like her name was Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee and them
Spat game, when it come to my ex dames?
I keep 'em in-line like rollerblades at the X-Games
Phonte never was the type to kirk out and stress thangs
Till the album dropped now you thinking my rep changed
Look, we ain't sleeping on the floor no more
But it's a strange misconception I ain't poor no more
That's bullshit, if they ain't paying, fuck a Promo tour
I'd rather keep my ass home and hit the porno store
So we hit the sex shop cause she wanted to get with me
Two shots of 'gnac she started acting so giggly
Nine months later she went into delivery
And since then I treat my baby mama so differently, word
[Hook: Kanye West]
Aww, I see now
You was hurt and you on the rebound (aww)
Ben & Jerry's and Mickey D's now
And you just gone gain all that weight on me now (naw)
Naw (naw), fall back
If I ain't a player then what the hell you call that?
A nigga disrespect me I'mma be in all black
But baby if you let me I'mma take it all back

[Outro: Kanye West]
All back, yo I swear I'mma take this truck back man
I mean I got the new G5, whatever
That shit be in shop every two weeks
I told 'em, I told 'em if y'all don't take this back
And give me all my money back and trade me in for the CL
I'm gonna put it on this Little Brother song in two weeks and
And they ain't believe me but
Now I'mma let y'all know don't go out and buy the G5
I swear like it's a bad look for the girls
Really they get in the car
And they always wanna look over and be like
'Aw nigga, your check engine light on, it's on'
I'm like 'Your top on
So we got two things we tryna get off right here'
They don't like that
I take it back, I take it back, I just say it to get you mad

Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right 'cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah!

But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around

I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you

Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you

I'm a drama setter

Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me

And got Glocks in the Lex, so we ride behind cops
Broke days, we used to put water in our cereal
Now we're crossin' borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montana on full-body armor
Soning niggas, like Alfredo in The Godfather
Two-shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
And the AR-15 bending your six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

At any given instant {gunshot}, another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperment
And we holdin' them K's, that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged they throw him in cages?
But now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils' baby blues

Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggas amp you money
‘Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for Pamper money
Move like Keyzer, Jayson Williams, slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire

What you know about light planes and heavy coke?
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats?

I was out for twelve hours and went right back in
For three hots and one cot doin' time in the pen

Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it

Ha-ha, can y'all feel that?
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh

[Verse 1]
Here I am, in the place where I come let go
In Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work, all play, okay?
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me and Charlie at the bar, runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like, ""Hi, Will!""
Can y'all feel me? All ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out, ""Will, we loved your last hit!""
So I'm thinkin' I'ma scoop me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees in the Caribbean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay, papi!""
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound, anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
And if you ask how I know, I got's to plead the fifth
[Hook]
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimme your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jet skis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, everybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise, in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home
Miami
[Hook]
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn

[Intro: Nas]
Life
I wonder.. will it take me under?
I don't know
[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked
Evidently, it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing ya clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""
See Nas LiveGet tickets as low as $112You might also like[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxing
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Opening eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six-digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa!
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait! I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit!
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em, baby!69Embed"

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was workin' at the club, you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got somethin' to say

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian (Uh)
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little somethin' on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talkin' 'bout you, yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Starin' at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the Ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood (What?)
But hun, you got the goods like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week?
She simply said, ""No,"" labeled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hun, I don't get down like that
[Verse 5: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep' in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture
Shaheed, Phife, and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ, and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty, let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down (It ain't nothin' nice)
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down
Relax yourself, girl, please settle down

My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson
[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating

But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew, bo bo bo bo)

[Verse 1]
I'm bout to hit you with that traditional style of cold rockin'
Givin options for head knockin non-stoppin'
Tip-toppin' lyrics we droppin' but styles can be forgotten
So we bring back the raw hip-hoppin'
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin'
Cop some breakdancin', boogie poppin', and lockin'
Tic tockin', guaranteed to have you clockin'
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin'
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin'
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo, I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin'
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin' your money on marketing schemes
And pretty packages pushin' dreams to the fiends
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be, son
I'm not the run-of-the-mill, 'cause for the mill I don't run

Until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is TIGHT AN GOOD
TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD

All in yo' ass crack, Cocaine? Don't pass dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
MC's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus

[Intro]
Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal; it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

[Verse 1]
Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-comin' live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot, it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway & Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor — better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""Cha-pow!"" — you dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like $69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everythin' that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right — you are not alone
Rock your hardhat, black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facin' life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell, but they could rock you at PlayStation
This New Math is whippin' motherfuckers' ass
You wanna know how to rhyme? You better learn how to add

8-year-olds gettin' found with 9mils
It's 10PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumpin' krills to keep they bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers tryin' to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you gotta find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got they gun in your back
Bubblin' crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks, but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is bidness; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits
The system break man, child and women into figures
2 columns for ""Who is"" and ""Who ain't"" niggas
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret — the million other straws underneath it
It's all mathematics

[Verse 1: Posdnuos]
Up in them 5-star tellies saying two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without saying the producer's name all over the track
Yeah I said it! What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that A grade shit
Now quit now before we pour
That sure shot pure rock cocaine flow

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
From the top of the key for three, villain
Been on in the game as long as he can wheelie a Schwinn
Turn the corner spinning, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to free power like LILCo
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay youths when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose V with a fur collar
And charged a fee for loose leaf words per dollar
Ya heard? Holler, broad or dude, we need food
Eat your teams for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon him for the mix-up

DOOM brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam and 'em

You slow, you blow the soup on you fools, his own Boss like Hugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Badass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from being hot
It's about if you can handle being cold or not
And we was told to hop on no one's dick by Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the praise or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from the other way of thinking
Hey your lady's winking, I think you need to control that
Or I'll have to hold that

There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady!
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together — it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me, the Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say, so it's left a untold fact

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I'm trapped in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low, the juice go
But never that! As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-O's lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin, when he got bagged, that fucked me up, God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're Upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two-to-four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get, I'm stayin' in the projects forever!
Jakes on the blocks — we out-clever
If beef, we never separate, roll together
When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin' cute! I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin' L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the 'Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize
[Chorus: Mobb Deep]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 1]
If man is the father, the son is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe, then why
Is this verse comin' six times rehearsed?
Don't freestyle much but I write 'em like such (Word)
Amongst the fiends controlled by the screens
What does it all mean, all this shit I'm seein'?
Human beings screaming vocal javelins
Signs of a local nigga unravelling (uh huh)
My wanderin' got my ass wondering
Where Christ is in all this crisis?
Hatin' Satan never knew what nice is
Check the papers while I bet on ices
More than your eye can see and ears can hear
Year by year all the sense disappears
Nonsense perseveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

[Hook]
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin'
What is game? Who got game?
Where's the game in life, behind the game behind the game
I got game, she's got game
We got game, they got game, he got game
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game if it ain't sayin' nothin'

Damn, was it something I said?
Pretend you don't see so you turn your head
Ray scared of his shadow, does it matter?
Thought of reparations got 'em playin' with the population
Nothin to lose, everything's approved
People used, even murders excused (You preach to 'em, yo)
White men in suits don't have to jump
Still a thousand and one ways to lose with his shoes
God takes care of old folks and fools
While the devil takes care of makin' all the rules
Folks don't even own themselves
Payin' mental rent to corporate presidents (My man, my man)
Ugh, one outta million residents
Bein' dissident, who ain't kissin' it
The politics of chains and whips
Got the sick missin' chips and all the championships
What's Love Got To Do with what you got
Don't let a win get to your head or a loss to your heart (Word)

And a new world order is about to begin, y'knowhutI'msayin?
Now the question is - are you ready, for the real revolution
Which is the evolution of the mind?
If you seek then you shall find that we all come from the divine
You dig what I'm sayin?
Now if you take heed to the words of wisdom
That are written on the walls of life
Then universally, we will stand and divided we will fall
Because love conquers all, you understand what I'm sayin?
This is a call to all you sleepin souls
Wake up and take control of your own cipher
And be on the lookout for the spirit snipers
Tryin to steal your light, y'knowhutI'msayin?

[Intro]
Yeah, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

[Verse 1]
I never knew a luh-luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light, but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort, I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close.. to the Most High
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
You might also like[Verse 2]
It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch, or even my boo
There's so much in a name, and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anythin'
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anythin' worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh, darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
[Verse 3]
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side

Basically
Can't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental, based on instrumental
Records, hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the king
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the cream
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad, fish accept it
In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece, protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket
Niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files, I'm sick
Insane, crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Out her fucking mind, now I got mine, I'm Swayze

[Interlude: Booster & Method Man]
When I was a likle stereo (Stereo)
I listen to some Champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
When I will be di number one (Tical)
And now yuh listen to di Gorgon (Gorgon)
And a Gorgon sound a Rein
An' any jump and come tes' mi (Test me)
Mi a-go lick out dem brain (it’s like that)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Brothers wanna hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse, word to God
It's the Wu comin' through, stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned that when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll
[Interlude: Method Man]
What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style (Northern spicy brown mustard hoes, word up, we be hazardous)
We have to stick you

[Chorus: Method Man]
Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (Motherfucker, I'll fuckin')
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real (Slide you down a rusty razor blade into a pool of alcohol)
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real

[Outro: Method Man]
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel at some staircase, piss

Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she finna have? She don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no Rock n' Roll
She want platinum or ice and gold
She want a whole lot of something to fold
If you a obstacle, she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad, and these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told her ""Girl, look here, calm down, I'mma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan, cause you's quick to learn
We can make money to burn if you allow me to lay this game""
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

[Verse 2:  Cody Chesnutt]
I don't ask for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standing where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock n' Roll""

Uh huh, Cadillac need space to roam
Where we heading for? She don't know
We in the city where the pros shake, rattle, and roll
And I'm a gad-dang rolling stone
I don't beg, I can hold my own
I don't break, I can hold the chrome
And it's weighing a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One
And Black Thought is bad, these streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
I never played the fool, matter of fact, I been keeping it cool
Since money been changing hands, and I'm left to shine
The legacy that I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name, now listen to me

[Verse 4: Cody Chesnutt]
I don't beg from no rich man
And I don't scream and kick
When his shit don't fall in my hands, man
Cause I know how to steal
Fertilize another against my lover's will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Ooh, ooh, ooh no, dear
You'll be keeping my legend alive
[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
Oh, break it down, break it down, down for me

[Hook 2: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've taken my test
Deliver it Mary: it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it ""Rock-N-Roll""

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right

Yeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z & Alicia Keys]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (Dímelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say ""What up?"" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out (Come on), I could trip a referee (Come on)
Tell by my attitude (Come on) that I'm most definitely from

In New York (Ayy, uh, yeah; aha)

You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to act
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Monte

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse—don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA (Come on) got you feelin' like a champion (Come on)
The city never sleeps (Come on), better slip you a Ambien

The employees of the year, yeah, we're back to work
I took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Due to the fact they wack in their track
Have to go back and stack 'cause they lack
The ingredients EPMD and scratch for that...
*DJ Scratch cuts and scratches*
Yo, I'm the hip-hopper, plus the show shocker
Down with MD, yes, the microphone doctor
One wrecks, the other destroys
And if you think that you're ready to mess (Kill the noise)
We don't play when it's time to slay
I get a cut from my homey, yo, then I lay
Back and mack and all the rhymes I pack
And wait for a sucker to jump and then attack

[Parrish Smith]
Well, I'm known to be the master in the MC field
No respect in '87, '88, you kneel
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
Wax a sucker like Mop & Glo (That's word bond)
Smacked a second time, but on a different assignment
And do a sucker new jack who needs a rappin' alignment
'Cause I'm the cream of the crop when it's time to do a show
Girlies on my jock for my dope intro
As I glance at E-Double, king microphone wrecker
Turn on my cordless, sayin' mic checka
To the ladies ... and all party goers
Some call me P, and others slow flower
Brothers on my jock, for the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

Puttin' heads to bed, straight out the box
MCs are jumpin' out shoes and socks
I'm not playin', understand what I'm sayin'
Catch a sucker in my way, and I'm slayin'
Takin' no shorts, showin' vital sign
You can tell by my lines that I'm gettin' mines
In '89, because I'm fine as wine
Sit back and recline, watch the sun shine
Take a stroll, listen to rock and roll
Catch a flick at the movies, dance or bowl
What I choose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh, my style is def, and as deadly as crack

[Parrish Smith]
While I'm slayin' music's playin', a sucker is delayin'
Battle in the trenches where the funky beat playin'
'Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
Not kin or blood-related, but you can call us cousins
'Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like 'I'm Housin,' 'You Gots To Chill,' and more
The proof is in the pudding (Yo, check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we would fold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?
[Erick Sermon]
Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes, the Boy Wonder
No foulups, no bleeps, no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""Sooooooo amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
'Cause me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

[Parrish Smith]
I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
'Cause you was mesmerized, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all-out battle, P comes out swingin'
'Cause I'm just the type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
And get mines on time, that's why most resign
Sit in my La-Z-Boy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine

I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written in kitten, hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve, embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd, man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy
And alleys are full of Phillies and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy, really!
So here we go, now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me... flow
Never mixin' with trickin' brothers
Bitchin' over vixens that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin', splittin' things that's bitten and gettin' written off
You're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off!
Before you even started, so what? So long, see you, fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it?

Yo D, what? Come on, yeah
What? What? Come on, yeah

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli & Both]
""Give me the fortune, keep the fame"" said my man Louis, I
Agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so, tomorrow comin' later than usual
Waitin' on someone to pity us
While we find the beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil, but I can't tell
You know what I mean? Pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells
Dollar bills, or is it the mind-state that's ill?
Creatin' crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion, there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal
What's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal, they be recitin' my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means bustin' gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son — no vindication of manhood necessary

Not strong, only aggressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite
Not who the nicest
Not good, but well behaved
Chasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave?
Still livin' like mental slaves
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice

[Verse 2: Mos Def & Both]
Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listenin' agree
That everythin' you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out runnin' in place, chasin' the style
Be a lot goin' on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be lovin' the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America — land of opportunity
Mirages and camouflages more than usually
Speakin' loudly, sayin' nothin', you confusin' me, you losin' me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walkin' the street, wonderin' who they be lookin' past
Lookin' gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song — just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht, but they won't call it the slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control us, you barely hold this
Screamin' ""Brand new!"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been runnin' across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressin', there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illin' that be fillin' up the cemetery
This life is temporary, but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie — let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive 'cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free — we only licensed, not live — we just excitin'
'Cause the captors own the masters to what we writin'
Not compassionate, only polite — we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved, 'cause the cameras survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasin' after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm tryin' to live life in the sight of God's memory
Like that, y'all
[Interlude: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
A lot of people don't understand the true criterion of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence
They ain't lookin' around
[Chorus: Talib Kweli, Mos Def, & Both]
Not strong, only aggressive
Not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite
Not who the nicest
Not good, but well behaved
Chasin' after death so we can call ourselves brave
Still livin' like mental slaves
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice
Hidin' like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis makin' you look twice

[Outro: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
Stop hidin', stop hidin'
Stop hidin' yo' face (Yes, c'mon)
Stop hidin', stop hidin' (Celebratin' death)
'Cause ain't no hidin' place
Stop hidin', stop hidin'
Stop hidin' yo' face
Stop hidin', stop hidin' 'cause ain't no hidin' place
Say, say it ain't no hidin' place (Not strong)
Say, say it ain't no hidin' place (Not free)
Say it ain't no hidin' place (Not compassionate)
Say it ain't no hidin' place!
Say it ain't no hidin' place (We well trained)
Better stop hidin' yo' face (Black Star)
Stop hidin', stop hidin' (Black Star keep shinin')
Stop hidin' yo' face (Yo, yo, yo)

You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton

Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton

Fatten my plate again, y'all cats know we always play to win

Haters took this shit too far, son
So that's all for you, I'm wipin' out your whole team
I'll splatter your dreams with lyrics to shatter your schemes
The badder you seem, the more lies you tell
The more lies you sell, and by surprise, you fell
Into my deathtrap, right into my clutches
Stupid, you know the God must bless
Every single mic he touches
I've suffered, just so I could return harder
Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr

I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
Cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like
(""What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!"")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all, I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall, I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, ""Why is everybody always pickin' on me?""
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95, I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown
I'm not tryin' to show, no macho is shown

One, two... so listen here...
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school, I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze

Is hella strainin' (to the brain and)
But I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin'

[Chorus: Slim Kid Tre & Bootie Brown]
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

Yeah, yeah
Fool, you know how we do it (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Nothin' but the Westside (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
You don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My troupe can kill, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double-parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Who got got (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
And who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
""Planet of the Apes""
I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want The Bomb (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Just like George Clinton
S-K-P is down to catch a body
Put on ""Knee Deep"", we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) you know how we do it
[Refrain: Ice Cube & Evelyn King]
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) You know how we do it

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Jack be nimble, and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick
'Cause I'm that fool from South Central
You'll think you stuck yourself (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
With a number two pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With ""Mo' Bounce to the Ounce"" in the dash
Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive, to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it
(Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) You know how we do it

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Can't spell ""us"" without ""trust""
Put the lust aside, there's some things we gotta discuss
So close your legs for a bit, baby, let's open up
Closed mouths don't get fed finishing lunch, her panties in a bunch
Tell me where you been at these last couple months
You say you want me back, so baby, don't front
'Cause I could never know too much but just enough
So the next nigga never feel he got the one-up
But we ain't gotta rush, take your time
We could talk until the sun up, I see you tryin'
To say what's on your mind, I promise to be fine
I could see the signs, be honest, I ain't blind
The truth is we all got our own desires, our own dreams
It's a big world, gotta try new things

'Cause transparency my love language
Can't see the bigger picture if your vision tangled
Love is like glass, either break it or you stain it
These late-night conversations turn into arraignments, just tell me the truth
'Cause I ain't tryna judge, baby, I just want you to be you
'Cause I'ma be me, keep it G like real niggas do
'Cause you knew a nigga way before he got famous on the block, nameless
And I'm proud to say the money never changed us
We've been through many phases like mazes, still we found a way
I never knew a love that wasn't painless
Pouring out my heart was always draining, I gotta say
Now every day, it's indigo rain, and yeah, this a brighter day
A lifetime I provide for you, by the way
Don't you forget that I would die for you any day

(""So, you're a philosopher?"")
(""Yes, I think very deeply."")
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Let us begin, what, where, why or when
Will all be explained like instructions to a game
See I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking you, ""Who is more dramatical?""
This one or that one, the white one or the black one
Pick the punk and I'll jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
Right up to your face and diss you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol, something far from a lover
Beside my brother, S-C-O-T-T
I just laughed 'cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two, ""My Philosophy""
Number one, was ""Poetry"" you know it's me
This is ""My Philosophy,"" many artists got to learn
I'm not flammable, I don't burn
So please stop burning and learn to earn respect
'Cause that's just what KR collects
See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk?
You walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style and learn to be original
And everybody's gonna wanna diss you
Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx
And every sucker MC had a response
You think we care? I know that they are on the tip
My posse from the Bronx is thick
In real real life, we roll correctly
A lot of suckers would like to forget me
But they can't 'cause like a champ I have got a record
Of knocking out the frauds in a second
On the mic, I believe that you should get loose
I haven't come to tell you I got juice
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
I'll be back, but for now just sekkle!

In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
I'll play the nine and you play the target
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
Or should I say start this, teaching I'm the artist
Styles and new concepts at their hardest
Yo, 'cause I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It ain't about money cause we all make dollars
That's why I walk with my head up
When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
A lot of suckers with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack
I'm not white or red or black, I'm brown
From the Boogie Down
Productions, of course, our music be thumping
Others say they're bad, but they're bugging
Let me show you something now about Hip Hop
About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
Mainly, what I write is for the average New Yorker
Some MCs be talking and talking
Trying to show how Black people are walking
But I don't walk this way to portray
Or reinforce stereotypes of today
Like all my brothers eat chicken and watermelon
Talk broken English and drug selling
See, I'm telling and teaching pure facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
And it lacks creativity and intelligence
But they don't care 'cause their company's selling it
It's my philosophy on the industry
Don't bother dissing me or even wishing we'd
Soften, dilute or commercialize all the lyrics
'Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
And hear it first-hand from an intelligent brown man
A vegetarian, no goat or ham
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
'Cause to me that's suicide, self-murder
Let us get back to what we call hip-hop
And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock
[Break]
(""So, you're a philosopher?"")
(""Yes, I think very deeply."")
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
How many MCs must get dissed
Before somebody says, ""Don't f*** with Kris!""?
This is just one style, out of many
Like a piggy bank, this is one penny
My brother's name is Kenny, that's Kenny Parker
My other brother I.C.U. is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker: the king or the teacher?
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
Kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along nor sing a song
'Cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?
I say yo, what's up? It's me again
Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
With Criminal Minded, an album which is only ten
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
No more than four minutes and some seconds
The competition checks and checks and keeps checking
They take the album, take it home and start sweating
Why? Well, it's simple, to them, it's kind of vital
To take KRS-One's title
To them, I'm like an idol, some type of entity
In everybody's rhyme, they wanna mention me?
Or rather mention us, me and Scott La Rock
But they can get bust, get robbed, get dropped
I don't play around, nor do I eff around
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
When some clown jumps up to get beat down
Broken down to his very last compound
See how it sound, a little un-rational
A lot of MCs like to use the word ""dramatical""

(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I'm a nice dude (Uh), with some nice dreams (Yep)
See these ice cubes? (Uh) See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide-wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
*Ticks* You should think about it, take a second *Ding*
Matter-fact, you should take four, B

Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ *vinyl rewind*
(Two, re-pe-re-pe one, yep, three)

I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live (So don't)
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little

I'm a bad boy with a lotta hoes
Drive my own cars and wear my own clothes

Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh, you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue

(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)

And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on

Peace, peace, peace, y'all
Strange
Real strange, real strange
An overdose, a nickel bag of funk
Now move on, move on, yeah
Hey man, are you ready to go?

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, Ahmad play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like run your coat black
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rocking Clarks where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth
Swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some where I'm from
The beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G where I'm from
The fire hoses blow
It's purple when it snow
I do a hit and go, split
It's hip, what's hip?
When hip is just the norm
'Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my mother that it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist, to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothing, for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blasting 'til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but don't play the role
Where you from
You might also like[Verse 2: Doodlebug, Ladybug, & Butterfly]
Weekend Dig Plans got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Clarence 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beats and got fly
(Why?) That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids where I'm from
We living off the boom boom crack
It's that hip-hop rockers, jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue 'cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot, right foot, one, two, mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair, here's a bib, have a listen
Of hardhead intervene (Damn, I know you're fluent)
Yeah, 'cause Doodle ain't having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from

[Verse 3: Ladybug]
Venus acts a fool at the square right? Yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right? Yeah
Hip-hop made a point last year right? Yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right? Yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz that sweat the hip-hop
Rising like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics. we say those are fat
Doodle, Mecc and Silk, the quad where it's at
We need to stack a sack for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips just like busting caps
Rip it 'til dawn, kick it 'til dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

Hey OG
Could you tell me how to find some good weed
I need it homie oh so bad
That last bag was the best weed I've ever had
Bass so deep, I can't even seem to feel my feet
Girls so fine, I can't help it got to make this one mine
I hit em with my, gangsta lean
They can't separate my music from me

Time does change, but the music it remains the same
I hit em with the music from the slaves
Oh my goodness, what my ancestors gave
I don't want you to think I don't know
They taught me how to reach deep down and touch the soul
Without my music, where would I be?
You thought me how to cry and still remain a G

Ayo, Doctor, here's another proper track, and it's phat
Watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe Loc and you'll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his own album covers he was a she-thang
So, nigga please, nigga please
Don't step to these motherfuckin' real G's

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no business, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these motherfuckin' real G's
[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city — but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin' G's

[Chorus: Eazy-E, The D.O.C. & Dr. Dre]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like bootcamp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin' G's

How did you know?
It's what I've always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table?
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it? (I just, I just live)
Can we settle down, please? (I live day by day, fighting demons)

[Verse]
I smoked away my brain, I think I’m going dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they’re going numb
I’m having stomach pains, now I’m throwing up
'Cause I’m a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, now let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day me and my team, we can make it with this rappin'
Now we swaggin', makin' money in Manhattan, trick, what’s happenin'?
They try to intellect with indirections just to test you
A rebel 'til my death, it’s in my flesh, it’s in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with, I’m finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I’m disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick
Spit clip, spit quit, split quick, hit kid's women
Oh, that’s your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It’s A$AP nigga, live with it, swag

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

Now, who got the flav' that comes a dime a dozen
That keeps ‘em buzzin’, thinkin' that they phat when they wasn't?
Welcome to the world of Mack, or Mackman
Leave you small guys sayin', I eat MC's like Pac-Man
I'm incredible, better eats ya vegetables
'Cause, I does what I do you (Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin', mackin', full effect mic check one-two
I'ma reign, reign forever
Rain like bad weather, reign like whoever, never
You can't bite my style
'Cause my style ain't a style that is a style so I can go buckwild
Bet you figured you got more funk for flow, it ain't so
Flava in Ya Ear, letcha know!

Burnin' MC's leaves a foul scent
See, I'm like what ya call, king of ""Yes, ya'll""
My style's Rick, sick, I mean real sick
Shit's thick, I come with the ammo
The real whammo-slammo stuff that I be droppin'
And I'll wake the great, let's warm up the hot plate
I'm changin' fate from the neck I'ma castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass 'til it stank, if you stomp, I dominate
See, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers!
To me, ya all suckas 'cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buck us, we roll bulletproof
No cooth, on the roof, bitin' like a saber-tooth

Can leap a tall building, crush the Earth for fun
But I'm sayin' ain't no fair, yo, when MC's run (Ain't no fair, ain't no fair)
The mic's now in the right hands
'Cause the Mack’s on the Earth just to spoil your plans
More pep than the pepper that's in ya pepper shaker
Ruff earthquaker, couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring with unknown to man slang
With bigger bite than the Devil fang
I ain't met who could hang, if ya testin' in ya lesson
Got me dressin' for ya funeral session
Man, it won't even matter no more
Craig in '94 just won the war
My style was definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin' lookin' over in a four door Chevy Nova (Why I oughta)

In the world of dollars, ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter

So let me get down and pound other MC's in the ground

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fucking mouth
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showing all his boys how he shot 'em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got 'em
Now, everything is cool in the mind of a gangsta
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five, ayo, 24/7
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you, wannabe, gonnabe
Cocksucking, pussy-eating pranksters
Is when the fire dies down, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
Feeding the poor and helping out with their bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now, I'm in the U.S. making deals
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean, one that you don't really know
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz
Hitting switches in my black '64
Now, gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangsta here was a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now, all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eating, cocksucking pranksters:
When the shit jumps off, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil J
Now, bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digits, take her out
And end up hitting the ass with the meat
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the game-players
And everything's quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't telling off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All you hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let a mothafucka shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
'Cause damn it feels good to be a gangsta

(""And now, a word from the President."")

[Verse 4 - J. Prince]
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Getting voted in to the White House
Everything looking good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor getting down
Like letting a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supporting me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
’Cause now I got the world swinging from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta29Embed"

Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…
You might also like[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck
[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""
[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)

You need never ever gotta go to yo' wallet
Long as I got rubberband banks in my pocket
Five, six rides with rims and a body kit

And, no, she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desire like that, yeah

I wanna do my thing so we be established
And I don't want you rockin' them fabrics
Girl, I wanna give you carats 'til you feel you a rabbit

That's why I don't mind doing these things for you
You did things for me I wouldn't believe you did
That's why I always want to keep you here
In a year or two, girl, I could see you with my kids
Girl, you make a thug want to get a legal gig
It's only right we spend our lonely nights
Gettin' crazy biz till we awake the kids
Don't get too loud, got respect for you honey
To keep it all real, you come second to my money

Six in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my old-school tape
Mad with no music, but happy 'cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 2]
Seen my homeboys cooling way, way out
Told 'em 'bout my morning cold bugged 'em out
Shot a little dice till my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories 'bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly, simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Verse 3]
Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a Louis interior
Solid gold, the ride was raw
Bust a left turn, was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high-school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see?
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, forty-four and a hand grenade
Threw me in the county high-power block
No freaks to see, no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble, but the shit must fly
Squabbled with this sucker, shanked him in the eye
But just living in the County is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 4]
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later, but still had the juice
My homeboy Hen Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant, Nat C's clocking dough
Be-Bop's a pimp, my old freak's a ho
The batter-rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, ""Man, you out early, we thought you got ten""
Opened his safe, kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask
[Hook]
Word

[Verse 5]
I bought a Benz with the money, the rest went on clothes
Went to the strip, started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done, on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint, but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble, but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shotgun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All casualities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had time to ask

[Hook]

[2014 Remaster part starting]

[Verse 6]
Swat-team leader yelled, ""Hit the floor""
Reached in my pocket, pulled my forty-four
Dove across the room, peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the backdoor like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley, jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red, the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops woulda shot us on sight, they wouldn'ta took time to ask
[Hook]
Word

[Verse 7]
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed
One more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no ""La-Di-Da-Di""
'Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing sixty, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's, who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 8]
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV
A technician with a mission, that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would've got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
Then she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid, pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop while I was screaming for more
After she waxed my body, she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 9]
Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my AMG
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile, yes, cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red, some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail, said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we was going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 10]
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there
Hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest, the rest we passed
Back-door'd the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce
We never catch static 'cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask

Yeah! Ladies and gentleman
Broadcastin' live to you and yours
It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bouncin', c'mon

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
The first day of the rest of my life (X!)
X stand behind the mic like Walter Cronkite
Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keepin' my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon' shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut
Hennesey and orange juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while the pistol range
Goin' up and down my dick like the stock exchange

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X!) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X!) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X!) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X!) to the Z and we all in the family
(X!) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X!) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X!) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X!) to the Z and we all in the family

Ever since Xzibit could spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next ex-wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefer, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop-top tinted on twenties
Usin' rappers like crash test dummies, stackin' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinkin' right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X!) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X!) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X!) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X!) to the Z and we all in the family
(X!) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X!) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X!) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X!) to the Z and we all in the family
[Verse 3: Xzibit]
What an event, we hardcore a hundred percent
Makin' it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
Seem like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Call Doc, bounce to the spot and slide right in
I ain't tryin' to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennessy, rock plenty of ice, make it a double, and scream

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X!) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X!) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X!) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X!) to the Z and we all in the family
(X!) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X!) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X!) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X!) to the Z and we all in the family
[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
So there you have it - A-B-C, D-P-G-C
X to the motherfuckin' Z
Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant, Xtrordinary, Xciting, X-a-lotta
XO with a little bit of Xtacy
X-ing your bitch-ass out if you tryin' to test the G
And what's the recipe? Xcalibur weaponry
And we shoot Xceptionally
That there is hot
X marks the spot?
Fuck naw, X spots the marks

(We were sitting out on the step, you know)

[Verse 1]
Now I'ma say this one time, boy, and that's my word
We rockin' shots and not fire through the Hindenburg
The contribution is clear, you add water to bone
And get the Jurassic 5 on the microphone
Now if you like the tone and how the harmony's done
And the sucka emcees die before they've begun
Well, I'd like to know if you've got the notion
'Cause we're number one
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours
I'm just on some other shit
I'm all about the beats and the lyrics
So when you hear it, you can feel it
The vibe is energized by the presence of my spirit
No interference, we persevere
The purpose is clear
We're here to leave your ear hurtin' severe
You're lurking in fear
'Cause we take it back like Robin Loxley
Rockin' from countryside to spots where hard rocks be
I often wonder if these emcees even know how it feels
To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel
It's not about the bills, that's not keeping it real
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
'Cause it's the hundred-watt bloodshot Game of Death
'Cause we're protected by the covenants of words and beats
Rewind and feel the heat, recline and take a seat

So, uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets

Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic

[Verse 2]
Now I walk from Tranzania, earthquake Transylvania
And on the way, I kicked a hole through the Wall of China
Just to get the right blend
'Cause I'm schizophrenic of the pen
Wait a minute, I fell into the deep end
You shouldn't have told me
The pyramids can hold me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your beats, pull out your cuts
Give us a mic (What up?), and we gon' tear shit up
I'm on some old and forgotten
Sun up to sundown like picking cotton
The Nutty Professor science droppin'
Rockin' Robin's hood from New York to Compton
Me and my three sons, Jabari, Shakir, and Kahsum
[Chorus]
So, uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees

Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic

[Verse 3]
Hey, I'm 2na-Fish from U-N-I-T-Y
Do or die, anti-Illuminati, why
Do the liquid from my vocals make the ghetto start swimmin'?
Forever winning, I'm in it like Meadowlark Lemon
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
A sucka emcee freestyle, he had mine for lunch
Marc 7even get you open like an attaché
Briefcase, in this case, the victor is no way
Ah, ah, the tool spinners, cookin' a full dinner
Killin' the firstborn of lyrical Yul Brynners
When is it the academy rattling your anatomy?
Gotta be J5 so kill all of your fake flattery
That'll be the day when labels pay our way
2na, what you say when emcees come to play?
Man fi dead, 'cause we take it back like Spinal Tap
Preparing your intellect before your final nap

So, uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets

Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks
Just that classic rap shit from Jurassic
Let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats from real live emcees
Playground tactics, no rabbit in a hat tricks

[Verse 4]
Just got beef, huh, watch how I settle it
I'll fuck around and arrest your whole development
I'm eloquent when it comes to digital display
I'm ready for the world while you 'url off the Tanqueray
Tactics, my shit's Jurassic 5
Fingers of death while you exhale and inhale
With a deep breath with my chop suey style
'Cause I'm a lyrical chef, I gets mines to the death
'Cause I be cookin', from here to Brooklyn
Your shit's annoying like fat-ass Bookman on Good Times
When I rhyme, I hit the designated area
I hope you got your shots, 'cause this is lyrical malaria
Spreadin', beheadin' fools with the punishment
I live in America, but fuck this government
A hundred and fifty times over silk with lead
While y'all drink the Similac, my rhymes are breast-fed
No artificial nipples, I flip the real skills
I thought I told you once, I kick the lyrical windmills
And backspin Benedict strictly for my benefit
I step on toes when I flow, don't get offended
Come and get with it, comprehended when I kick it
I represent the real from the beginning to the end of it7Embed"

Now, playful pulpit-pussies poppin' junk with the pistol
Sweated because I'm dreaded, let's get ready to pull a fistful
Of extinction, reachin’, quick on the trigger, sneakin'
And then send a flurry of bullets diggin’ deep in my flesh and wreakin'
The props 'cause they pops lots of mops heads drop
Dead plots, a cop, eager and ready to lick the shots hot
Ready to kick the plot so wipin’ the flop and then I vanish
Managed to escape by the skin of my teeth and then say, ""Damn, it's a shame,"" the brain is washed, to the point when it's savage
Beasts, I rest in peace, simply before I annex
Insanity; why can't there be a resolution? I ask you
No answer, so fuck it the next time my life is threatened, I'll blast you
Packin’ the black steel, makin’ the mack's feel pain and fear
As I smear blood from buckshots to the brain
Pump! Pump! Pump! Listen to the bullets hum as they buzz past
Your ears and dig in, drillin’ into your cranium
Not a gang-banger, crack-slanger, never done had the rep kid
Yet sweated, frequently, see me and step with
Intent to kill spilling your blood for your sins
Defends my livelihood 'cause rivals could bring ends to
My youthful bliss bustin’ a trigger gun and missed this
Bullets, to the vital organs, in order to assist
In your death, your last breath havin' spasms as I has em’
The idea is demonic and the thought is surely sad
And not a murderer, ensurin’ the longevity of my life, I'll
Live and let live, kill if I must, I shall

Damn, I wish that I can have bliss, daily
Lately, I try to speak my piece but words fail me
I'm dwelling in the halls of appalling sights of evil
I got to sweat the devil plus I got to sweat my people
Do I gotta blow them brains out to get them chains out your head?
The mackin’ mentally offends to be dead
Deceased I gotta a peace deeds 'cause the beast be
Lurkin’ up in them, so now I'm buckin’ them
And stuck in them, the herring fits means tricks
You learn it when you plunder and tell me to run the kicks
You might trip, and find it hard to swallow this
But follow this down a dark alley and you're catchin’ hollow tips
You got yo' shit, I got mine, leave it at that
Respect T or thank me, when I shank thee
Necks, 'cause clever dreads can sever heads weasel
I may be thin but my lead friends be diesel
A law-abiding citizen but shit it's been long enough
Strong and tough, sniff this and you're snuffed
Stifled, step lively, don't try to bust me
Trust the fact that I'm friendly and yo, plus
See that I love humans—they hate me
I'd love to live and let live but no one's T
So until then I chill when it's possible

Yo
Thy shall not kill—I will if I have to
You say I'm the one promoting violence—well, I ask you;
Have you ever heard the sound of bullets passin' you?
Ever thought of goin' out with someone blastin' you?
Willin' to be killin' maybe is a great sin
But it's not appealin' when bullets penetrate skin
What pain when a brain leaves a stain with the quickness
So I get a fool if I think that I'm on his shit list
With the swiftness of a Glock nine
So now who got your back? 'Cause my gat got mine
Find a brother with some dreads and now you figure you're gonna kill him
Well I grab my gun when I see one I'm gonna fill him
Why should you live in fear thinkin someone is gonna get ya
I bet ya, before he gets me he'll be on a stretcher
So no nigga pulls a trigger on the S-O-M
And if there's more than one, I'll have to kill the rest of them
Buckshots, leave a body ripped, 'cause I got equipped
With a shotty quick, that nobody wanna riff with
Get split open with the fury of the lead, G
Rat-a-tat, tat-a-tat, flat is what your head be
Dead see, why don't brothers wanna let me function
When I pull it, kids be eatin' bullets like a luncheon
Adam got a magnum and I tag 'em with this weapon
Be threatened, 'cause Adam be pullin' a pistol if you're steppin'
I don't like it but I guess that that's the way it has to be

Damn, you gotta go get somethin' to eat, man
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker, man
Ayo, man
Damn, what's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, man, he coming
Ah! (Oh, what the fuck?)
Ah, son, pull off, pull off!

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

Somewhere my heart turned cold

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say, ""Only God can judge me,"" 'cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in GoodFellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie? (Homie)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

Mic Check
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
Come through, dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC
Crowd around
[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6' 0"" sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac

I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number seventeen, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition ""super-villain"": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown

‘Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like ""Pass the peas like they used to say""
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Y'all mythological niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
Come to hit you with this Edition, it's all brand New
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who
(Who? Who?) So who? (Who?)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes 'til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

Waiting for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like an organic compound
That's the way of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound
I represent my clique like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the Earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown
Freaking the funk in any throw down
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you

I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damaja amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger from the double edged banger
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity
I internally, get in you

I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D
[Chorus]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job

I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm loving how you look in my eyes, swanging them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
She got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy

I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my ON-LY
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MIE
[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah...
Don't know what fucked me up more: watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)
Big house, big Benz – girl, it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all the night, we can have a baller night
[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby

I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby

You ask your mom “Please?”, but she still says “No”

But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of *jerk*

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with
See Big Sean LiveGet tickets as low as $241You might also like[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up out of town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwestern
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be the baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just gotta cast it
[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you want a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been
[Outro: Big Sean]
I know it look like like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Take you places other niggas can't take ya

Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
""Golf"" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Refrain]
Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

[Verse 1]
It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly, I miss this nigga, like, when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it, I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze, cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened
It's evident in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at

Uh… time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse, crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome
Trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, ""I like attention""
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, ""Thanks so much,"" you made my life harder
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right

Your other one? Evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, but the walkin' depends
If you can’t understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em

Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door

And they movin' weight, it's no exercise

You could see the hustle, you could recognize
Overcame struggle when the Devil tried

I'm not a two-steppin' man, I said, ""I do not dance""
It's a gun inside my pants, and the whole world's in his hands (Dance)
It depends, penny for your sins (For your sins)
Shootin' up the block, can't stop revenge (Oh)
Nappy dreadlocks like a rasta man (Rasta man)
Where the story ends and the plot begins
Uh, look, momma said, ""The messiah's in moccasins
Tryna save the kids in them apartments
And show a way to live with other options""
Opulence, decadence, black excellence and lots of it
I could cop the newest Bimmer, Bentley or Balenciaga's
I could pay for this lil' nigga scholarship
I ain't caught up in rap nigga politics
Play with me and you playin' yourself
Playin' with death, say him a prayer
Cathy and Carl got a K on the shelf
I'm in DeKalb County open-carryin', caterin', chef
Cookin' up another plate of the best
Me and Christo got it poppin' like it's Crisco
Fried chicken, I'm lickin' her thighs
Then I put my face in her breasts
I took a drive, my plug on the West side
Of Atlanta, he known to finesse guys
With the hammer on Campbellton, headshots
On the camera, knock out a dreadlock
That's a felony charge, he caught a F
Niggas come to the A and get X'd out (Facts)
But I only been here 'cause I'm tryna help
Only one you can help is yourself now

Life is a journey, you know? Not a destination
Lean not towards the egoistic intonations (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Positive vibrations bring real liberation (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
It's the will of the heart, the strength of the mind
And the love of the creator that will help us rise out of these sadistic situations (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
And experience the purity that exists in our creation, you know? (Oh, oh, oh, oh)9Embed"

[Intro]
Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

[Verse]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to
Grind like that to shine like this, in a matter of
Time I spent on some locked-up shit, in the back of the
Paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, ""Yeah, I do""
If you want it, you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got shorty, she tryna bless me like I said ""achoo""
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga, please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between of what we started
Lil' nigga, but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without a album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga (Ah)

Hold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Woah)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah, that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I'm the type to count a million cash then grind like I'm broke
That Lambo' my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my tote
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas try take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' thirty G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)
We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Woah)
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like, ""Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?""
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up (What?)
If you diss me in your raps, I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no, that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet, like that lil' engine, I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on twelve o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that loc'
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me (Me), hoes waitin' on me (Me)
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there's beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks, they go for forty, ain't no ten a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch (Mitch)
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone

Minolta, devil exposure, wide-lens view
Check credentials and niggas next to push the Benz through
You know the glow iced out rings, long doe
Spandex, Moshino, hoe bitches lettin' they thongs show
I played the game, took plenty paper, still remain the same
Asian name, barrel link chain, lettin' my piece hang
Domestic, no more crime play but still connected
It's ethics, calculated steps through geometrics
Waves spinnin', double shades of beige linen
'97 expedition, displayed with all the trimmins
Travel light, push the LS on casual nights
Have you ever puffed the chalice weed pipe? That shit will have you right
I roll dice, tryin' to divorce from this cold life
Used to sell coke on the strip, but now I hold mics
And plan soon to pack and vacate somewhere in Cancún
Escape to a cozy estate filled with mad rooms
Furnished up, too many foul niggas, time to turn it up
Push about a buck and shift gears, burn the clutch
'Cause it's like this, for these chips I strike swift
Preciseness, precious jewels of life — that's priceless
I payed my dues, and through it all, I never trade my shoes
Cash rules, new crews who made the news
We all for paper, I guess greed is just a second nature
Indeed, shots of Henrock and weed'll escalate ya
Some mostly touch along the line crossed up
I took the shortcut, puffin' on blunts, bustin' off nuts
The night type, love dime bitches and night life
Casino dice, sexy strip dancers and white ice
I seen the movie, most of you niggas couldn't move me
Truly, it's like a 6-shot ruger against a Uzi
So bust or run, or cock back, bust your gun
But I fake none, I remain like the sun
Bless the strong livin', intellect and long vision
Connects in prison, and real niggas wit' recognition
So respect the mission

It's important to practice good hygiene
At least if you wanna run with my team
I'm 'bout to get into some shit that I've seen
This fool's breath hummin' so bad it'll melt your ice cream
They say don't say nothing if you can't say nice things
Sittin' too close to him on BART, like my eyes sting
I try to be subtle, hand him a stick of gum
I was a victim of breath on hum
Running his yap about what sets he from
Gotta get some gum, gotta gets him some
He turned it down, his teeth was brown
Excruciating, foreign, it was a new sensation
I had to ask the dope to pass the soap
'Cause his coat had the stench of crustaceans
Or bathrooms in a bus station
He had a can of Olde E and some raisins
Amazing... head to toe B.O
He didn't know, used to the fragrance
'Cause as the days went without bathing
He felt manly and not like a maiden
He had one dread, and fungus
Said he worked on peoples' toilets with plungers
Girls, not the guy you would want to tongue ya
So guys take your cue from this little number

You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky
You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky
*scratching* ""To wash up""

[Verse 2]
Now in class you need total concentration
But there's kids in the back holding conversations
Crackin' on each other, and neither were poster boys
Both of 'em smell like the type that soap avoid
Coast enjoyed a leave of absence
One's fool's feet smelled like it struck some matchsticks
Brimstone, girls would never bring him home
I was laughin', then his friend raised his tone
And said, ""Bud, you earled all over yourself,"" yeah
I go so deep on your ass, you'll be submerged
Like you need to do in water 'cause you smell like a turd
Wanna cap? Get some courage, your feet smell lurid
Go look it up, and while you're at it, get a cup
And squeeze the sweat out your sweatshirt and drink it or gargle
You get our vote for most stinkiest
That nigga started thinkin' of shit, said I was frail
I said he was stale, underarms is ripe
Undergarments tight, about to leap out your holey sweats
And we holdin' bets, and after this I'm gonna collect
Nigga check, yourself, respect yourself
And wash your mothafuckin body 'fore your sweatshirt melt
Like radioactive, no lady find you attractive
The funk got you captive
You don't need a map, bitch
[Chorus]
You gotta wash your ass, if you must
You gotta wash your hair, if you must
You gotta brush your teeth, if you must
Or else you'll be funky

You gotta wash your ass, if you must

[Verse 1: Mac Daddy]
So many times I heard you rhyme but you can't touch this
I'm kicking the type of flow that makes you say, ""You're too much, Kris""
So feel the fire of the one they call the Mac Dad
The fire's what I pack and what I pack is real bad
I'd like to grab ahold of your soul and never let go
Do the jump, do the Hump, and say (""Ho!"")
Now that's the state of mind I'm in, huh...
With rhyme after rhyme I win
The Mac (The Mac)
Known for breaking 'em off something
They laying in the back and front keeping your speakers pumping
The miggida-miggida-miggida Mac came to get 'em warm
And my pants to the back, that's my everyday uniform
You little cream puff Mac Daddy wannabe
Keep dreaming 'cause a Mac you will never be

I took a ballerina down to the ball dance
Met a couple ball players, found a ball stance
Now we in the bathroom, she found a ball face
Took some shots and balled out, now how the stall taste?
I can't even go inside, my old hoes might hear
I might need to hit the town, I need you right here, right here
'Til she reached in the trunk and found a nina
I told her, ""Baby, that's Nina Simone""
Ayy, drivin' through the liquor store faded, braided
Hands in this motherfucker wavin', hazy
'80s like the '90s and 2000s (Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh)
Drivin' through this motherfucker, wildin'
Ayy, Brady seven pack, they come in bunch
I been with the 'quad on a high note, gettin' C-notes
Different presentation to this vibe, you need a keynote
Presi' 'round this motherfucker, I ain't sendin' vetos
Ain't no stoppin' shit or stoppin' licks, them boys on G-O
Battin' out the 504, I saved her name as ""Creole""
Balance when I'm on a road, I get the go and T-O
Dominatrix Matrix when she do it like I'm Neo
Shit is off its sockets, they lock in
Mama said live up to my name, but they jockin'
They gon' try go and take your face for the profit
They gon' lie, they gon' slip and slide, get beside ya
They gon' try, we a hundred deep like Verizon
In the trees with the bumble bees on horizon
Ain't catchin' Zs, I been in in the V, on road to Zion
Sell they souls, hoppin' in that mode that I ain't buyin'

Send a chill up your spine like an eskimo
Here's a backstage pass to a funky show
Come give me a kiss under the mistletoe
Greg Nice, my life's like a fairy tale
Orca was a great big whale
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale
You won't tell, I won't tell

Took a little test, I passed, didn't fail

Tripping off the beat kinda, dripping off the meat grinder
Heat niner, pimping, stripping, soft sweet minor
China was a neat signer, trouble with the script digits
Double dipped, bubble lipped, subtle lisp midget
Borderline schizo, sort of fine tits though
Pour the wine, whore to grind, quarter to nine, let's go
Ever since ten eleven, glad she made a brethren
Then it's last down, seven alligator seven
At the gates of heaven, knocking - no answer
Slow dancer, hopeless romancer, dopest flow stanzas
Yes, no? Villain, Metal face to Destro
Guess so, still incredible in escrow
Just say Ho! I'll test the yayo
Wild West style fest, y'all best to lay low
Hey bro, Day Glo, set the bet, pay dough
Before the cheddar get away, best to get Maaco
The worst hated God who perpetrated odd favors
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod Lavers
In all quad flavors, Lord save us
Still back in the game like Jack LaLanne
Think you know the name, don't rack your brain
On a fast track to half insane
Either in a slow beat or that the speed of ""Wrath of Kane""
Laughter, pain
Hackthoo'ing songs lit, in the booth, with the best host
Doing bong hits, on the roof in the west coast
He's at it again, mad at the pen
Glad that we win a tad fat, in a bad hat for men
Grind the cinnamon, Manhattan warmongers

I knock 'em, knock 'em out the park when other rappers are hitting bunts
I'm a togger not a fogger, step on runts and don't do stunts
I got soul power, never took a cold shower
Never had a girlfriend the color of cooking flour
You can call me sleazy ’cause my rhymes are kinda greasy
Some brothers wear curls ’cause it ain't easy being peasy
Like a Kung-Fu flick, I stick you in the dick with my toothpick
Tell 'em Rick: ""You hit them harder than a fuckin' brick""
I like hoes in clothes but like 'em better in the sheets
I rock more beats than Jesse Owens ran track meets
Amazing feats move, they happen everyday
When the Ro to the J, bring his ass out to play
I weigh 180 but I'm fat
I ki-uh-kick up dust when I bust like a cap
Tha Alkaholik crew and what we're here to do
Is rock a show, knock a hoe and crack another brew

You'll get a right to the grill, I'm white and I ill

On a fat blunt, what punk? You don't know the half

Then you'll get a beaten just like an egg

But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off
We got the cake that you're tryin' to get a crumb off

No one has it, just us, that's it
If you try to take it, I got a big shillelagh

You call me a skinhead, I call you a pinhead

So if you're a ho, all my friends know
What ya gotta say? Let's hit the hay
And have no delay, and yo, by the way

[Chorus: Everlast & ""Cheech and Chong"" scratches]

[Verse 3: Everlast & Danny Boy]
""Extra Extra!"" read all about it
How could you doubt it?
Now scream and shout it
The House of Pain, soon will reign
Over the Hip-Hop scene in white, gold, and green
I rip shit and backflip like a Jedi
I roll with the groove and I'm smooth, and you can bet I
Come correct and get respect when I'm flowin'
Collectin' my dough, I got your girlfriend hoin'
And how do I know that she's sprung?
I know she's sprung, 'cause yo, the D's hung
Like a Shetland pony, gettin' paid like Sony
[Pre-Chorus: Danny Boy & Everlast]
So never ever try to play me out like a phony
'Cause I can get real
Thick like a bowl of Malt-O-Meal
And by the way

See, no one loves you more than me (More than me)
And no one ever will (No one ever will, yeah)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Top down, chrome spinning
You see the boss grinning, I'm loving these damn women
I let two get in, she tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, ""Nah, love, that's forbidden""
I ain't for squishing, that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust, I know them twenties real well
Now we coasting, me, two chicks and toasting
I turn up the volume, watch the bass get 'em open
Soft spoken with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they lovin' the ride
We was moving bodies before we hit the party
'Fore the DJ started cutting (I was already fucking)
Cinderella'd you girls, from nothing to something
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumping
Lose the face, you twos was great
But it's to the V.I.P., I got new moves to make (Get down)

[Verse 2: Malice]
Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy
We gets in for free, ""Ay, they with me""
Two stepping, you see each crew repping
Slipping on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweating
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time her song on
I like that, ma, you do something to me
Come this way and prove something to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but nah, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm toting
But I'm only here to party, y'all

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
When they say, ""Last call"", it don't mean the night's over
It mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, asked Pusha to choke her
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it, the whip appeal or my baby face?
[Verse 4: Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leaning
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-twos gleaming
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning
She added to the list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinning and my head spinning
Mine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chin and
I'm a winner, man (Get down)

I got a feeling a nigga could make a killing
If he packed up his bags and moved to New Zealand
New Guinea, New York, you need something new
Besides them fucking Newports, prepare to be dead
The streets said, ""Your shit's soft like wheat bread
On your own block, you make shit they won't knock""
I'm a worldwide hustler, hoes be at us
Cause of O.G. status, fans throw weed at us
And I spread love just the same
Let this Buddah bless your brain, sexy thang
Yeah, it's time to take this act on the road
Come back and get back on the

[Verse 2: Pep Love]
I'm lea-ving; don't nobody worry
I'll be doing my damn thing quick-fast in a hurry
Dream-weaving, keeping me and my team even
Shifting time zones, trying to see the seven seas and
Everything in between,
We heavy and we heavenly, so we love whatever we see
From the banks of the Mississippi
To the shores of Tripoli, we do more tours and wage wars,
I'm swimming in women and living without limit
My penmanship got me on a trip spinnin' around the world
Bullshit aside, we're on a worldwide ride, right?

Damn, baby, don't cry like that
I gotta get this money, ma, I'll be back
And he turned and walked into the world
Young man facing the land, chasing his dreams
Motivated by a picture of his daughters he embraced in his hand
Thinking what it might take him to win
And a nine to five ain't supplyin' what he tryin' to drive
Lucked up and got signed to Jive
For the deal, got a quarter mil', shot back to the house on the hill
And blow some dough to show, it's real
Flossed his wheels and lost his deal
But it's just a setback, ya boy got get back
Kept that ball rollin', God bless his Gs
Invest some cheese, and now they all rollin' (Heh)
Just doing what a man'd do
Handle your business, or it'll handle you
[Verse 4: Pep Love]
I got a vision of international pimpin' (International)
I'm into natural (Natural), women when I'm out travelin' with my compadres
From Oakland to Auckland
We always walk and talk like we got game
I've traveled the canals of Venice (Uh-huh)
And aroused crowds in São Paulo with a single sentence
I penetrate the language barriers with positive vibes
And bridge gaps with raps, keeping my spirit alive, and I've
Thrived, as I roam through zones
Collecting my paper with these poems and songs
Getting the girl, grabbing the money and runnin' (Uh-huh)
Starting up companies and keeping the product coming
Hieroglyphics' adventures all around the globe
Mental enrichment, and we gotta get the dough

So go on and go where you wanna go
See what you wanna see
Be who you wanna be
You say, ""Just trust me"", and I do
You know it's just a phone call away
The chance ain't everyday
When folks get to do what they wanna do
And you got a winning hand to play (Play)

[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 1: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

[Verse 2: Nas]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (It's yours)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Bridge]
Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today
[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder, damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffiti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours
I wake you up, and as I stare in your face, you seem stunned
Remember me? The one you got your idea from?
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of
Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke

I got a question as serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack? Nobody smiling
'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it, so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours
The E-M-C-E-E, don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those seven emcees
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar
I'll wait 'til E say, ""Play 'em""
So I'ma have to diss and broke
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke
[Verse 3]
I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation 'cause what I invent
I nominated my DJ for president
When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
There'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the moral of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
'Cause I'm moving the crowd, and B'll wreck the fader
No interruptions, and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
'Cause everything is real, on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And I'll take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple-stage darkness
When it get dark again, then I'ma spark this microphone
'Cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finished when the beat is gone, I'm no joke34Embed"

If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Wanna kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship

Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill

Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric

Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tango with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm

Now if you say my style is wack, that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg & Q-Tip]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer And me, the Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack
Aiyo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock What?
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
Um, let me see... damn, I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip? All the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yeah, all the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yo, all the time, Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Okay, if knowledge is the key, then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent Black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm
Well, it's kinda simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids, watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well, off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper, what you say, Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that, then stop

You say, ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say, ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on! Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, huh!

[Verse 1]
My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
I write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
Ahaha, from the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)
Full-blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum
Young man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (There it is)
While you still tryin to find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's En-ga-lish
But caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunition
(Chi-chi-pow) Move from the gate, voice cued
On your tape, putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself, akh'
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)

[Verse 2]
Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!) Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory, a class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you16Embed"

I was born in the Boogie Down cat scan
Where my building fell down on the rats and
People sold the super on a trip to the penile (penile)
While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle
My file is clean, I mean my mind is clear when I transmit
I am the man-ner of the family 'cause the pants fit
I want to let forensics prove that I can mends Groove
With the thread from needle outta hay, wanna say
Salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We 'bout to place you in that 3 Feet of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta ""hey love"" all the honies, cost me short term
Tallying a score for the shottie in the jacket
For the brother bes a nigga when he packs it
So get your butt out the sling, I stung Muhammad, float a note

Ayo, groove with the mayor, hazard on the sayer
Wave the eighteen mill', even still
Sack a bag of troubles, make a single double
Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd pro the jects
Lay it low and leg mad cassettes
I unconditioned my ways of the everyday sunset
Wagin' my days to the one bet
'Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin'
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
'Cause the days of the breaks be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm exploding
[Verse 3: Posdnuos]
I be the fab, I be the fabulous but see, unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name (ah one two, ah one two)
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin' on to when I caught the fame (ah one two, ah one two)
Pass the task to ask me 'bout the Native Tongue again, my friend

'Cause in the midst, man, it's alright
Momma got the book into my day-life
My pops got the belt, so best believe we sail the wave
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, I stay inside of my gates
Break days mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eye-scan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew old with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special
[Verse 5: Posdnuos]
Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew, we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the never-ending factor while I'm on, so tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
('Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo, he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin' up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round 'em up and get 'em back to the hotel
Motel, holiday, inn-fact
I'm gonna let you know, once again, that De La Soul
Is sure to show you we will hit the charter harder

[Verse]
I wanna be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in a direction
In the right way, told her, ""Inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say""
Chicago nights, they stay on the mind
But I write many lives, they lay on these lines
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise, I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back, or too far in front of me
The present is a gift, and I just wanna be (Be, be, be, be)

Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?
Nine pound, we rocked it
'96, strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send .22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

[Chorus]
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one-time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one-time
I ain't gotta tell you
Yo, it's right in front of your eyes

We rep the QBC, nigga, rep yours, it's all love
Milli' stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs
Adapt to gat sound and bow down
Slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better to concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind control you, double-edge blow you
In the B-I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world and evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop
QB City, Godfather Pt III
Gotti, Gambino, and Ty Nitty
Scarface, rest in peace

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
P.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us
I tell you what, black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)
Live up to my words, if I got beef, niggas comin' in herds (Nigga)
We flush through, your clique get purged (Word up)31Embed"

You can find me where the thugs be at, club be at
A fact, I love women, cuz they love me back
The name's Johnny, they used to call me sucker for love
But now I'm grimey, cops searchin' motherfuckers for drugs
Give me that bud, that come in nickels, dimes and dubs
At four twenty, when niggas knew what time it was
A shot of Remy, in my system, I'm buzzed
Then baby, I ain't just a little off, I'm unplugged

When I first spark the art's when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside

My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short — ""I want It Made"" like Ed, 'nuff said!
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed

And discover my level is that of no other

Unemployment at a record highs
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

People in the world tryin to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard, you want to compete

Huh!

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!
Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!
You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid

The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church

Do not be a fool who's prejudiced

Yeah
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind! (Whoo!)
Ah, uh, whoo, yeah! Ready?
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Let's go!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington & Kanye West]
(Can I get a encore, do you want more?)
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boys
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Get 'em Jay!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)
[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Jay-Z]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it
[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

Redefinition, turnin' your play into a tragedy
Exhibit level degree on the mic, passionately
Niggas is sweet, so I bet if I bit, I'd get a cavity
Livin' to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity
We die hard like the battery thrown in the back of me
By the mad MC who think imitation is the highest form of flattery
Actually, don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you
You get kicked into obscurity like judo — no, Menudo
'Cause you pseudo, tryin' to compete with reality like Xerox
Towards destruction, you spiralin' like helix, wipe them teardrops
Chasin' stars in your eyes, playin' games with your lives
Now the wives is widows, soakin' up pillows, weepin' like willows
Still more blacks is dyin', 'cause they live and they tryin'
""How to Make a Slave"" by Willie Lynch is still applyin'
Regardless, Mos is one of my closest partners
Rockin' ever since before Prince was called The Artist
Rockin' before Funkmaster Flex was rockin' Starter
When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool, before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosin', with every breath I'm enhancin'

So I run through 'em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinkin' they ship like Moby Dick to Ahab

My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinian, sure to hold the Gideon
Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim
Born inside the winter, when? Day after December 10
These simpletons — they mentionin' the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon, the Danish rings by Entenmann's
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen!) You got a tenement? Well, then assemble it!
Leave your unit tremblin' like herds of movin' elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddlin'
Makin' 'em WOOP like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington

Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Hoe, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

How you doin', miss? My name is L, I'm from Queens
I heard about your man, he like to lace you with cream
Dolce Gabbana, Moschino with Donna jeans
But he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend
He be playin' like a Willie 'cause he dress ya dove
Never knowin' that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin love, Duke is weak then he fallin' asleep
You on the phone with your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet

He ain't watchin' you, he rather watch his money pile
Can't protect treasures when it's in a glass house
Soon as he turn the corner I'ma turn that ass out
Full blown, frontin' in the 6 with the chrome
Yo B, why you leave your honey all alone with me?
Just because you blessed with cash
Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You got to try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love

See, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown

I got her smokin' beedies, modelin' bikinis
Pushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me
I keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn
Teaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned
Don't get it twisted, gettin' money ain't wrong

[Verse 1]
No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
'Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel

Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya

Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin'
But scared to kick reality
Man, you've been doin' all this dope producin'
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
So what you want me to do? (Express yourself)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm expressin' with my full capabilities
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
'Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and that'll make you think
Some suckas just tickle me pink to my stomach
'Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what?
I won't hesitate to diss one or two before I'm through
So don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well, I'm droppin' English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin'
But makin' a sucka and you equal, don't be another sequel

Express yourself (Come on and do it)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now, gettin' back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again — yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin' myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants 'em to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Though some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you won't hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin' for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know, it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to..
[Chorus]
Express yourself (Yeah, yeah, brothers always beefin', fall victim to the streets)
Express yourself
Come on and do it (Yeah, yeah, do it)
Express yourself (Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre in full effect and N.W.A)
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Express yourself

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
From the heart 'cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, movin' like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith & Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical
Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin', just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood, and he's up to no good
When I start expressin' myself — Yella, slam it!
'Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doin' damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straitjacket
I got knowledge and other suckas lack it
So when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like — it's like we gettin' hype tonight
'Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just..

They have no key or no clue
To the game at all, now they washed up
Hung out to dry

All missions impossible are possible, 'cause I'm

Days from now, I'll wipe the sweat from my eye
And each and every true will stick or fall from the skies

From homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
And the world's at a standstill, deep in broken-man's-ville
Trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
Killing yourself, and dogging ya health
You ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself

When I execute acutely over the rhythm
On those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give 'em
Got 'em mad and tremblin'
'Cause I been up in my lab assemblin'
Missiles to bomb the enemy
Because they envy me and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
'Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow the truth because it hurts
This is how I put it down, this is my Earth, my turf

That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And, uh) And my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no), 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me

So I open fire until you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama), come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)
When it's time to die, then be a man and pick the way you leave (Yeah, nigga)
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions
As a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

Yeah, make sure my shit sound tight

[Verse 1]
I never knew the world could be this mad
Only vision I had of sex was Color Me Badd
And I, I never knew the world could be this cold
Only time a nigga die, he was playing a role
But now niggas get their souls stole' so often
They only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
From NY, to Compton, down to Austin
She said that orphans morph into abortions without precaution
Problem with our people, there's too many wannabe Jordan
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin'
Too many wannabe actors instead of achieving their masters
At least a bachelors but no, too many wannabe rappers, hah
That's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrites
Like niggas in the White House supplying Wite-Out
On Jim Crow laws, you probably missed it
Hard to be persistent when you're tryin' to fight for your existence

[Chorus]
It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
Yo it ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis

Person mad nervous, you surrender to sterling
Look them in the eye, if looks made you die, you know you merk ‘em
Right there, plus his hide is like, right here
So you know that if you would fight fair then you'd have him like quite scared
But don't forget the TEC held high by your right ear
So listen loud and clear: you don't wanna lose your life, dear
And don’t you show a slight tear or let 'em sight fear
Just let 'em disappear in the night air, yeah, with yo' Nike Airs
Robbed by the crackheads left alone in the apartments
Mothers be jobless, so they make dollars shaking it topless, and
Daddy been gone said he, took off like ostrich
Since he gain knowledge, I’m keeping it with the synopsis, and
Shit like that make you wish you were adopted
To escape the pain, you join a gang and get intoxicated
Have no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
The only thing is you do it again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again

[Chorus]

You don't want that shit to be you, right? (Nah)
I know you gon' hold it down though, you know what I mean?
Just be careful, man, cause niggas out here ain't really worth it
You a ill nigga though, I like ya style, son
[Verse 3]
Imagine me fed up, a go-getter, for mo' cheddar
Po' never, blow Berettas ‘cause I, know no better
No Era, no STEEZ, no Kirk, no Lee
No school, no OG, no talent, no me
What if I just ain't act right?
What if I pack crack white with my sack tight, join the gat fight?
The click-clack type, slide in the vipe with the black stripe
And give my friends the back knife cause that's life, nigga

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Looking for a style like mine, you can't find it
They are the audience, I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckers on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage, and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no fronting, just to say a little something
You suckers don't like me 'cause you're all about nothing
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My all-around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissing other people's—
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attracting only women, got no time for little girls

I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MCs back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did
I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction?
You need protection when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a nine millimeter windpipe
You're a king, I'm a teacher, you're a b-boy, I'm a scholar
If this was a class, well, it would go right under drama
See, kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
Talking big words on the mic, but still irrelevant
Especially when you're not college material
Wake up every morning to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott La Rock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject 'cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MCs on the mic are frauds
Saying styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissing? 'Cause I am a musician
Rapping on the mic like this to me is fine
'Cause if I really want to battle, I will pull out a nine
You can see that Scott La Rock and I are mentally binded
In other words, we're both Criminal Minded
[Verse 3]
We're not promoting violence, we're just having some fun
He's Scott La Rock, I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat 'cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone relaxed and not tense
You waited, debated, and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See, I have the formula for rocking the house
If you cannot rock a party, do not open your mouth
It's that simple, no phony cosmetics for your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Say a rhyme for '87, not no 1983
Well-versed to rehearse, in my rhymes I might curse
Originality is first, but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include, I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to making music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the '80s came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's twenty-four tracks
After years of rocking parties, now I picked up the knack
Because everything that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?
I'm living in a city known as New York State
Sucker MCs gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians
Although our lives have been so uprooted
I haven't included, you can all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckers I be crushing
So now you are awakened to the music I be making
Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated
Don't get frustrated 'cause nothing has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ
You see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way

Don't waste your tears on me
I'ma tell you it ain't worth the fight
I'ma hurt you if you let me
I can love you only for the night
I can love you for the night, baby
Baby, I could play your role-play
I can tell that you're the only one
And I'ma promise that you feel pain
You ain't gon' get pain from no one else, yeah
Get it from no one else

Speedin' the Lamb', pray to the east, feet in the sand (Ayy)
Make your mouth piece obese like Della Reese
Puttin' squares in the garden, holdin' court in the streets (Ah)
I gotta go to heaven, I had a hell of a life
Fightin' my bitch, married the game, made it my wife (Haan)

Chopper under the dasher, blend with the Emirates (Baow, baow-baow-baow)
Coi Leray in L.A., no more parties (No more parties)

There's a cause and effect to every action
Hold you down, never slip up, like Derif Jackson (Woo)
If you can stand the rain, I'll get you that new addition

You know I'm a dog, you probably better off without me (Come on)

Feel it in your soul, it separates from your flesh (Ooh)

Uh uh, not Vanessa with the singing career

C, tell her that you want her love

'Til the booty starts makin' that clappin' sound
Which is cool, but your friends are chillin' in the other room
The clappin's getting louder, you don't want them to clown you
In this situation, what do you do: [What?]
A, you, plain and simply, back up off her
B, you hit it just a little bit softer
C, you take it out and put it in het butt
Well, D is what I do, so, yo, listen up:
I put a towel on the floor by the two inch gap under the door
Now they can't see me any more
Check the locks so they can't clock, but they can listen
There'll be no bargin' in and there'll be no dissin' [Dissin']
Gettin' back to my mission, break out the whipped cream and the cherries
Then I go through all the fly positions:
My head under her leg under my arm under her toe
She says, 'I like it when you scream, baby let yourself go.'
I hit it and split it, lick it and quit it
After the ride, put my clothes on and walk outside
And before anybody gets a chance to speak
I say, 'Yo, don't say nuttin', I guess I'm just a freak!'

[Intro]
(W-W-W-What is it?)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by that nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got they mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cuttin' school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and an arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, ""If he dies, he dies""
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwin' punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dyin', dead, yuugh

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother cryin'
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealin' it
Hit the pipe and start feelin' it
Ooh-wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, jeez louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took an L, started sellin' soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusin' his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, ""Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said, ""Son, how come you think you'll be my connect?""
I said, ""Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect""
He said, ""Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense""
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smokin' is my profession, let's get it

Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

He said my man JD is on freebase

I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin'
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?

Then wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said ""Oh, brother.""
I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another
Walkin' home, I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy he'll do some time

""Disruption of the court,"" said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge

Mix a nigga brain like some gumbo, uh, oh

I said I’m back on this beat
And I’m doing crack on this beat
Only reason you like k pop artists is because you wanna suck their feet
Nigga’s ugly as shit looking like the Eastern Island Head
And not only are you fatherless your special ed
How you diss the goat Kendrick and not get cancelled?
When it comes to the beef I’ll get it handled
Your rizz is negative 1
But it might stay that way
Cause your parents left you for your trash ass music taste
You dropped an EP that wasn’t better than red veil’s
Even Dom Corleo dropped a better EP
Stop playing
And you gay too
Talking bout how you wanna suck a dude
And how you gonna busy mid air
Nobody cares cause you ratio people on YouTube
This ain’t fucking Twitter
I’mma put your music where it belongs
Yup,the shitter

[Verse 2:FalcoSoFly]
But let me ask you a question
What do you call a rapper who talks shit but isn’t good?
Nah,just call them why question bro
Yuh
Claiming Yeat stole your flow but he invented it before you
Already said I don’t like your content when it showed up on the For You page
I’m finna rage
Cause they should put monkeys like you in a cage
You drop this trash ass music but don’t get paid minimum wage
Go find a job
Oh wait,this is your job?
How you gonna call NLE Choppa a random?
He got 21 million monthly listeners
You just call them a nobody because you never listened to them
Oh wait
You did
You think it’s funny to be racist?
Well wait till I pull up with a white robe and burn your ass
Curious George looking nigga
He hangs from trees
I don’t know if that means swinging or your body hanging from the tree
Hopefully the second one cause if I kill you then I’ll never see your ugly ass again
Touch some fucking grass
What you mean Pessi?
You take a penalty every time you drop a trash ass song
How you gon call it a good duo if one person carries?
I can name you 21 duos that are better
One of those involve Savage and Drake
There’s also Thugger and Hendrix
And there’s Keem and my mans Kendrick
Also Travis Scott and Kid Cudi
And you get the point but my point still stands
Yuh

You know who’s more attractive?
Justin Bieber
Talking about Destroy Lonely’s album being bad
That’s as atrocious of a take as saying that Donald Trump is the best president
Hell nah
You got competition in Canada
You got Drake and Tory Lanez
Don’t play with me bruh
Talking bout Ken Carson ain’t that good
Shut the fuck up
Before I run over you with a truck
And one more thing
You called Tina Turner a skeleton
That’s disrespectful
Imagine you die and people clown you like never before
You probably wasn’t proud Mary
You look like a nigga working at Indian tech service
I know you ain’t talking shit through the computer
And you got the bum ass Samsung
So you in no room to talk
After I beat you with a shovel
You won’t be able to walk
Why else do you think I call you out?
Your content is garbage
Try a different route
That doesn’t involve that or music
I think I know what you need to do instead
Find your fucking father
That’s what
And be fucking normal for once in your goddamn life
This is why nobody fucking likes you
Bruh
If you were in the car,I gave you the aux and you played BTS
I would drive that car off the cliff
And jump out as it hits the landing
Cause you most likely would be dead by the time it lands
Your music taste is so atrocious that Apple Music had to get rid of your whole library
Talking about the Durk album being mid
At least he makes better music than your bitch ass
Bro your music taste is so bad that Spotify didn’t even make a mix for you
It didn’t liked what you were doing so they tried to delete your account
Bro your music taste is so garbage that YouTube Music had to remove 10 of your playlists
Bruh stop playing with me
Your music taste is so manure that when you post a music take to Twitter
It automatically gets taken down
Bruh you’re so ugly that when you tried to do a face scan
Your phone sent out a nuclear threat
Bruh your fingers are so nasty that when you tried to do a fingerprint scan your phone self exploded
Bruh your name is so weird that the Starbucks employee probably gives up when trying to put it on the cup
Bruh your forehead is so big that I can fit 3 busses in there
Bruh don’t make me find out where the fuck you live
And fuck Joe too
He tried to call me out for snitching
But his name is fucking Joe so he has no room to be speaking
And he was gonna drop a trash ass diss track
But I’m gonna scare him into cancelling it
They call you almighty chin cause that shit’s bigger than your shrimp dick
Bruh stop playing with me
You’re such a Ryth dickrider
That you might as well be sucking the shit now
With the white on your face
As you lick your lips and say
“Oh yeah,that shit was tasty”
That shit wasn’t milk
You know what?
Shut the fuck up
Both of you
I should take your Internet privileges away
And both of you are racist
I have no sympathy

Ashanti LyricsHi, I'm the Rap Critic! Let's talk about Fat Joe… technically for the first time, since, ""Lean Back"" was by Terror Squad, even though he just happened to be rapping on about 77% of it. Now, I want to correct a little mistake I made in that episode, because I had said that it was Big Pun who was the leader of the Terror Squad and that when he died, the head of the group changed over to Fat Joe, but in actuality, it was Fat Joe that founded Terror Squad, and then Big Pun joined them later. Which is weird to me, because, I mean, Big Pun is, like, Mr:

""Rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity filling""

I mean, he always came off as the guy in charge, and Fat Joe, *sample lyric from Twins* I mean, he's not bad, I don't want you to think that he sucks, but… he's… when your standing next to:

""A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support""

You're gonna look like second in command, whoever you are. And in addition, it was kinda Big Pun who became more popular than him in such a short amount of time, with hits like ""Still Not a Player"" charting around 98, and Fat Joe not really having a big hit until 2002 with this song ""What's Luv"", and guess what? Both of them were ""Thugs Need Love Too"", songs. Although like I've always said, you can talk about anything as long as you make it interesting, and with Pun, he had the asshole rap personality down pat. You see, the man was so brash and upfront with his delivery, it was kind of endearing:

""Bet Ya Man Can't do it like this
He can't work the middle, cause his thang too little""

""I don't wanna be a player no more
(I'm not a player, I just fuck a lot)""

And that's what made him likable: the over-the-topness of his lyricism made him enjoyable to listen to, as well as having outstanding rhyming abilities, and in addition, Pun was just more fun. I mean, for a guy who looked like this… he knew that he had to do something to compensate for his appearance, and so when making a love… okay, it's just a sex song, there's nothing lovey dove about this:

""I rip my prick through ya hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers""

But, when making this kind of song, he always came off as a guy who did not take himself too seriously

""Litte brown hairs everywhere""
You might also likeHowever, with Fat Joe… well, like I said, he's not bad, he just came off like he was trying to fit in with the crowd and not stand out at all. I mean, for God's sake, he had Ashanti singing the chorus, who was, at the time, the go to ""Thugs need love"" singer for Ja Rule's songs. In fact…

What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Y'All}
What's love?

Is that Ja Rule on the chorus with Ashanti? Well, he's not in the video, but that's obviously his voice. Jeez, Fat Joe, were you just trying to trick people into thinking this was a Ja Rule song? I mean, he doesn't have a verse anywhere in here, so what other purpose was he here for? Or maybe, his presence was so ubiquitous around this time, the very essence of Ja Rule just started spilling into other ""Thugs need Love too"" songs

*singing*: what's love… *Ja: Got to do… go to do with it, babe*
*look confused* (Just … keep singing) Wha… what's love … *Ja: it should be about us….*

Okay, we've wasted enough time, is this song by itself any good? Well, let's start off by actually looking at that chorus

What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Uh}

Okay, so this is an obvious homage to the Tina Turner Song ""What's Love Got to Do with It""

It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

[Hook:]
Oh what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion

And this song is about a woman trying to protect her feelings by devaluing the idea of love as nothing more than a chemical reaction to an arousing stimuli so that she can convince herself that it's meaningless. It's about someone who doesn't want to be hurt again, and it uses the verses to build up to the theme of the chorus. Okay… so what's THIS song about
What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it babe) {Yeah, Yeah, Uh}

So, they just start the song with ""What's Love Got to Do with it""… with what? What's love got to do with what? What are you referring to when you say ""it""? What, was there something in the intro I missed? What did they say there?

""Irv Gotti!""

What's love got to do with Irv Gotti? The point I'm trying to make is, when you have a phrase like, ""What's Love Got to do with it?"", you need to have a lyric that it has something to do with first. I know what you're referring to, but you haven't told me why you're referring to it. It just feels like, ""Hey, you know this song exists, so we're referencing it!"" And that's not even in Rap Music, that's English! A pronoun like ""it"", refers to a noun, something you did not give me! But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe they explain

What's love? It should be about us, it should be about trust babe

Okay, so now we're given a little context! She's saying that love SHOULD be about them being together, and it SHOULD be about trust. Okay, so from that, I can assume that the singer and rapper are in a relationship, and things aren't going so well in that relationship. Well, let's see how the rapper, Fat Joe responds to what she says

Yeah, slow down baby
Let you know from the gate I don't go down lady

*long pause*… well--*cut*

Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye
But you talk to much man your ruinin' my high

…Well--*cut*

You say you gotta man & your in love

Okay, BACK UP a minute! Let me try to figure this out. So, the chorus is all about how Love is supposed to be about trust and being together. I got that. And then, the first thing you thought to say to jump off from that is...
Yeah, slow down baby
Let you know from the gate I don't go down lady

So, this is kinda the conversation I'm picturing here:

Girl: Hey, babe, I love you, but I just want to make sure that our relationship is based on us trusting eachother
Guy: I don't do oral sex
Girl:… okay, I don't think that directly relates to what I was talking about…
Guy: …you can… ""Trust"" that I'll never do oral sex?
Girl: This isn't gonna work out…

And NEXT, you say

Girl you get me aroused how you look in my eye
But you talk to much man your ruinin' my high

Which is not exactly the most romantic follow-up to telling a girl you won't go down on her

You say you gotta man and you're in love

Wha, wait a minute, wait a minute… YOU'RE not her boyfriend? Well, who the hell are you? Wait, are you the person that she's cheating on her boyfriend with? I guess that gives the chorus better context, because now it's like she's saying ""I'm cheating on my boyfriend purely because I want to have sex with you, so what does love have to do with what we're doing?"" My question is, ""who said it did?"" If you're obviously only having a one night stand with this guy, and you have a freaking boyfriend back home, I'm pretty sure no one's under the assumption that love has anything to do with this, so why did YOU bring it up? That's liking asking ""What do cleaning products have to do with fishing""? Well, nothing, they're not even close to the same category, but now that you brought it up, I think that there must be something there. With this song, if you listen to any of the lyrics, it's obvious that it's not about being in love, it's about sex, but it feels like they threw the word love in there to make people think it's a love song. You see, this is why I hate these ""Thugs need love too"" songs. There's always this air of deception. Like, ""oh we said love a lot in the chorus, but naw, I'm not REALLY trying to get in a relationship"". Dude, just SAY that you want a one night stand. I guarantee you that your groupies are gonna be down for it. You don't need to lie to them

You say you gotta man and you're in love
But what's love gotta do with a little menage

Nothing. Love has nothing inherently to do with a three way. However, if you wanted to, you could go into how one of you may be confusing love for sex, or that someone is conflicted about how they feel about the other, but you never do that. Both of you seem pretty comfortable with what's going on. There's no ambiguity about what's happening here. There shouldn't be this many questions floating around

Me & you
Could just slide for a few
& she could come too
That's love!

That's love? But wait, I thought it was clear that there was no love involved with in this situation! Why does that change now that this third girl is involved. What, do you love her? I don't… ah, whatever...

Mommy, I know you got issues
You gotta man
But you need to understand
That you got something with you

Hold on, is he telling her to go back to her boyfriend? Because it sounds like he's saying, ""Hey girl, you've got a man, but you need to understand that you've got something there. You've got love, and a caring relationship, even though it's not perfect. Well, that'd be interesting… judging from the rest of the song, though, that's probably not what he means, but that last line is so vague, I have no idea what he's talking about. She's got something with her? What, a meatball sub that she didn't finish, i mean,  he is FAT Joe, so, okay, that can't be it, maybe he's just using a vague phrase to talk about how hot she is?

Ass is fat, frame is little

Thought so

Tattoo in your chest with his name in the middle

…Why would you bring that up? Do you, like, get a kick out of knowing the name of the person she's cheating on?

I'm not a hater I just crush a lot

Oh okay, he's not being malicious, like, he doesn't hate the guy who this girl is cheating on, he just really likes sex. Although, I think it's funny that he uses the edited version of the phrase from the Big Pun song ""Still Not a Playa"", because in both cases, I'm pretty sure the edit was intended to mean that he gets easily smitten with a lot of chicks, and you know, develops a crush on them. However, when I first heard the edited version, well, I'll just say that the verb ""crushing"" doesn't exactly lend itself to a positive image when describing the sexual exploits of overweight men. I hope the women were always on top, is what I'm trying to say

Not my fault cause they love the kid
Maybe the chain or the whip
I don't know what it is

You. you don't know what it is? You just, can't figure out why women would possibly be attracted to a popular rapper who brags about popping bottles and driving fancy cars, and your deductive reasoning led you to believe these women were purely attracted to your necklace? Well, gee, Fat Joe, I hate to burst your bubble, but these girls were only attracted to your winning personality. Women just can't get enough of the fact that you tell them they talk too much, and they swoon and sigh over your complete refusal to reciprocate oral sex

You came here with the heart to cheat
So you need to sing the song with me

Yep, you already made the choice to ruin the trust in your relationship. Don't be shy now just because he made a song about it

When I look in your eyes there's no stoppin' me
I want the Don Joey Crack on top of me

She wants that Don Joey Crack on top of her? Like, Fat Joe's butt? I… I didn't know you were into that, Ashanti. No wait, I'm sorry, apparently, one of Fat Joe's aliases is Joey Crack, which I'm guessing was his drug dealing name. Wait, no, No, that doesn't make any sense, since Drug dealers usually use code names that DON'T directly allude to drugs. No respectable drug kingpin would name himself, ""Mikey the illegal drug dealer"". It kinda ruins the point of having a code name. So, no, I'm not convinced: this line is totally about Fat Joe sitting on Ashanti

Don't want your stacks (Yeah)
Just break my back

You know, I don't think her light, airy singing voice is matching the topic she's talking about. Like, she's singing as if she's talking about something innocent, like ""I don't want your cash, just hold my hand!"" when she's actually singing something along the lines of, ""I don't want any money, just rupture my spinal cord"". But hey, maybe she's into that sort of thing. Maybe she just really likes having her body squashed by obese men. I mean, really, listen to this again, and imagine a fat guy across the room about to bellyflop Ashanti

""Come on… and put it oooon me…. on me…""
*imitating Ashanti's portly lover*: ""I'mma put it on ya, girl!""

Okay, that's enough of that. Overall, I'd give this song a 2.5 out of 5. The beat's fun, and admittedly, the chorus is enjoyable enough to sing along to, but it all falls apart as soon as you start to look into the construction of the lyrics. Fat Joe, while not terrible, seems to just lack the energy and personality it takes to make this type of song forgivable, so I'm just left with yet another bland character who has sex with someone else's girlfriend, and when you don't do or say anything to liven it up, fellas, it gets kinda old. Well, I'm the Rap Critic, I analyze the lyrics, because no one else does *comes towards the camera*Embed"

Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (Y'know?)

[Verse 1: Craig Mack]
Peace to Brentwood Town Shipping
I'm smoother than that Lex your whipping
With the rack and pinion
And Pirelli tires that be gripping
Sometimes I wonder if MCs really know
Mack's eternal bought to burn you
While in ten feet, of snow
I grab the mic and turn into Ali Baba
With just a dabber, my rhymes are guaranteed to grab ya
I got funk with the bass and soul
Cause I've been rockin' on the mic since nine years old
And I can groove with that, stupid fat
Rhymers when you're soupin' that
MCs catch a headache
And find where some Nuprins at
I'm on the case like Magnum P.I., F.B.I
Lookin for a man with the reason why
And it'll cost more than Lee Majors
To fix MCs after I kicks my flavor
Puff and Puff and blow the House down
Is what the Mack do whenever I get down
Gettin' down, boy (get down)
One two, Mack man's in full effect
You might also like[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
I'm like the greatest rapper, known to man
Got MCs meltin' in mouth and not inside my hand (c'mon)
And you can try to, write a rhyme-a
But the pace that I race'll have you lookin' like a old timer (old timer)
Do you wanna pay a visit, to rhyme exquisite (aheh)
That'll leave you standin' colder than a winter blizzard (AHH)
Mack's engaging, extra blazin'
Who's you phasing?
Power Rangers ain't more amazin' (amazin')
Rhyme flipper, flip-a-rhyme=a-ripper (uh-huh, say what)
Rip-a-rhyme-double-dipper while you talkin' on my zipper
I wanna know who's been naughty or nice
With the device, turnin' grown men into mice (yeah)
I can flip funk back and forth, forth and back
Ride more super rhymes against the track, tell 'em Mack (tell em)
I got Bad Boy as my back (that's right)
As we kick on the funk called MC subtract
Got flow for days, got rhymes to amaze (uh-huh, c'mon)
Got the brand new funk, here's the brand new craze, boy
Mack the dope (one two)
We break all of the funk on down (yeah)
[Chorus: Puff Daddy & Craig Mack]
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (Mo Bee, make it..)
Gotta keep my flow (Bustin out, in the house)
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
(One two, as we get busier)
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (We gon' get like this)
Gotta keep my flow

[Verse 3: Craig Mack]
Come on everybody, let's all get down
Got rhymes by the ton while you weighs a pound (Whoo)
Supercalifragilistic type of hyper MC
That be me, twenty-twenty could not see (Can't see)
I don't feel the pressure, of an MC aggressor
That I got a rhyme for in my top dresser
(in your top dresser) Craig Mack, Bad Boy representin
Fat Funkster be gettin', for Fat Funk be hittin' (C'mon)
It's this man's turn to earn
Since my birth, a penny now is MC's worth (C'mon)
And MC's are nuttin' but a joke-a take a toke-a
Smoke fatter than the Ayatollah
Can't nuttin' ever stop the Craig Mack plans
To grab MCs, and crush 'em in my hands (as we get busier)
Like I said before, here comes the Mack I
Power-back black, making cement crack (Cement crack)
As we get busy y’all (As we get busy yall)
In nine-four with the funk that hits on the floor
[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough

Taking short steps one foot at a time and keep my head low
And never let go

I think my mind just goes outta control
And judge your subjects muthafuckas read about
I touch on the shit that they be leavin' out
I seen this muthafucka's 9 smokin'
I seen the same nigga with the 9 die with his eyes open
And simply what this means is
He didn't know that every dog had his day
Until he seen his

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight then you haven't met the apes

Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on Ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And, yo, I'm a slave 'til my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 3]
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom, not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that four-four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make a move, got a point to prove
Gotta make 'em groove, got 'em all like, ""Ooh""

Latin Kings, Disciples, Vice Lords, Haitians
All these motherfuckers been patiently waitin'

[Verse 1: The Game]
Since the West Coast fell off, the streets been watching
The West Coast never fell off—I was 'sleep in Compton
Aftermath been here, the beats been knocking
Nate Dogg doin' his thing, DPG still poppin'
I got ""California Love,"" fuckin' bitches to that 'Pac shit
And Westside Connection been had it locked, bitch
I'm in the rear-view, my guns is cockin'
I put red dots on a nigga' head like Rodman
All Stars, fat laces; gun charge, court cases
Fought that, not guilty, I'm back, niggas hate me
Been there, done that, sold crack, got jacked
Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back
Payback, homie, I'm bringing C.A. back
And I don't do button-up shirts or drive Maybachs,
All you old record labels tryna advance
Aftermath, bitch—take it like a muh'fuckin' man

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If you take a look in my eyes
You see I be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game, tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)

Gangbangin' is real, homie—I'm living proof
Like Snoop Dogg C-walkin' on top of the Devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse about this and that
'Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep gibberin' and jabbin', I pull the .38 Magnum
And get to clickin' and clackin'
Your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton, see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be Spike Lee of this gun-clappin'
Prior to rappin', I was drug traffickin'
In the dope spot, playing John Madden
Homie, I ain't braggin', I took five
You wanna die? Run up on that black 7-45

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If you take a look in my eyes
You see I be a gangsta 'til I die

New York, New York, big city of dreams
I got my L.A. Dodger fitted on, I'm doin' my thing
Got me fucking with G-Unit—you know the drama that bring
I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens
And Buck told me in Cashville I'm good when I come through
So I ain't gotta tuck-in my chain like DJ Pooh
I'm gangsta—more like Deebo when he was Zeus
Play Bishop, I paint that picture—now, who got the juice?
You niggas is Nutso—I'll take off your roof
Leave your ass stretched-out like a Cadillac coupe
God gotta let me in Heaven, all the shit I've been through
I was a O.G. in the hood before I turned twenty-two
Homie, I let the .38 special rip through that vest
And I don't contemplate whether or not he left his shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back, I'm starting to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these Dre records

You see I be a gangsta 'til I die

Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?

Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year

'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right
[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'

Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night

Yo, when you look in my eyes, what chu see?
A sincere man or just a bunch of G
Why second guess, the brotha would last
They took a whole clique from the George and the Ave'
The booties in Aruba, boats and hoover crafts
So if Biggie could love the dough, Murda could love the cash
Butter Benz, gave the Tahoe to my other half
If she got the Benz then guess what mami have
Why dread it, tell the waiter too much ice in the crib
Blink's so drunk, he think we singing ""Nights Like This""
He say when he grow up he want a life like this
Sleep all day and plus you want ice like this?
While girls throwin' head I ain't even touch dice
I ain't trust Don King, how my trust Mike?
I date bull daggers, ain't I don't trust Dykes
Need a cleaner nina, cuz they don't bust right
I ain't stingy, when everybody see the plush life
Buy rims before the benz so I look just right
Girls love me try to get the girls that love Mike

And if you ever feel like you wanna creep

We hit the block, shop alot
She see her man, but she don't wanna drop the top
And you know that don't really mean a thing to me
Can't no girl ever run game with me

Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin us a Band Aid

Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro

So get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
So cash your checks and come up

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Wake up, and I see that my sister was already dressed
She said, ""I'ma run and go get my stamps""
""Watch and make sure no one snatches my check""
Nigga, that's the mailman
Sort through the mail and put it up into me pocket
So I be hittin' the 99 to get me a dub for 40 duckets
But ain't no bucket ride that RTA, hop on the 10 to the Clair
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs
And to cash that dum, man, I gotta get paid
Playa, playa, holla, holla, St. Clair got much to offer
Whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock-Glock for some dollars
So, get a bag of yayo and a quarter O, oh
Most all of my niggas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke
Hittin' that reefer hydro, you know the cut so fuck them po-po
Toss all that yayo then roll with a pound and stay low
Runnin' through the alley and into the mêlée
Up on the second the sundown
Those run from January, November, December
I'm lovin' the first of the month
[Chorus: Layzie Bone & Bizzy Bone]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Gotta grind, gotta get mine
In the hood that I claim and I slang on that double 9s
Gotta find them dubs
Gonna get a 40, can a thug get love?
What's up? Try to slang on my corner
Nigga, you's a goner, St. Clair niggas don't like that
And sellin' them dummies, makin' that money
Come back, nigga, get pap, pap
From the 1st to the 15th
Niggas smoke plenty weed but I gotta save, gotta come up
Put my rocks on the cut
When I get high, nigga, blaze that blunt, huh
Time to roll to the pad, count up my profits and add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back, see for niggas that's tryin' to rob me, fool
But never no shorts or no losses
Dumpin', keepin' these niggas up off me
See, gotta search the whole block
Spend a couple of bills, thugs smoke a lot of weed on the first

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone & Krayzie Bone]
Wakin' up, feelin' buzzed, up early mornin', stretchin', I'm yawnin'
Lightweight, bent, chugga-lugga take a 5th to the dome
Instead I kick it with my trues
But it's the first, so I'm gettin' me hustle on
Hop on the phone, callin' up Krayzie Bone
Wanna know, did your O.G. check come?
Sure, put me down!
I'ma hop on the bus with Biz (yo brother, let's get drunk!)
And I'm comin' with blunt after blunt of the skunk
Nigga T just put me down
Oh God, how I love when the first come around
Now I be freakin' me Black N' Mild
Headed cross town cause niggas, the first get celebrated
Rushin' to the block cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild, 'cause I'm gettin' me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the first, just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes and 20's and 50's
The firsst be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine, fool, and I'm workin' late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cause I got them rocks for them pipes
Come, come with-a ease
I gotta get paid on the first, gotta blaze up my spliff
Get live with the Bone Thugs
Poetic Hustlaz and the Graveyard Shift, on the first

Go ahead, lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

Hey, we live and we learn, we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
It's not appealin' as you truly speak your feelings
I'll be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back, best believe it'd be forever
'Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters

And we like different minds workin' off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin' off the same train
In the end, makin' it right's the main aim
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame

If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out
You havin' problems with your family then work it
The things we go through just to work it out
I work it out when the situations seems unworkable
Unreversible  but God is most merciful
Many works, many men converse
With soul search sweat it out

Travis Scott & Gunna) (Azərbaycanca Tərcümə) Lyrics[Nəqarət: Gunna]
Hər şey alovlanır, sevirəm istini
Coşdurdum şəhəri, rekordu qırdım
1 neçə milyon qazandım, yanımda tonlarla pul
Tarix yazdım və özümə daha çoxunu qazandırdım
O qaqaş hörmətsizlik elədi mənə qarşı, Fox TV'ə çıxdı
Yemək çubuğu deyirik buna, çünki səni yeyəcəyik
Follies’dən alıb çıxardım arvadı, çünki amcığı çox qəşəngdir
Nike kimi qaçıram, artıq işlər kontroldadır

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eynəklər, boss mənəm, üstümdə kostyum amma qalstuk yoxdu
Ayıq gəzmirəm mən, həmişə başım uçur
Canada Dry'ma bir az sirop tök
Gedirəm kosmos gəmisinin içində necə ki Bonnie və Clyde
Narahat olma balam, əmanət yanımdadı
Chanel və Birkin, qız qərar verə bilmir
Ona son model Mercedes sürprizi edirəm
Görməzdən gəlməzlik etmə, arvadvın amcığı mükafatımdır
Belindən tutub şeyimi arxasına soxuram
Daha böyük Maybach, bu elə belə orta boylu deyil
Qutan quşu kimi uçuruq
Qancıq, sən ağıllı zad deyilsən, bilirəm artislik edirsən
Saatımı reklam elədim, Sky'a baget hissələri əlavə etdim
Mahnı oxuyurmuş, ona imza attırıb bütün həyatını dəyişdirə bilərəm
Qarqara edib dikdabanlar üstündə gəzməyi öyrənməsini tapşırdım

Nəğd pul, para, çeklər, nəğd
Adderall, Birkin, təptəzə uzun daraqlar
Tək başıma sikmək istəyirəm qancığı
Amma elə bayaq qardaşıma ötürdüm onu içdiyim Sprite kimi

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Təzdən sport Bentley aldım sonra Cayenne'nin içinə tullandım
Qancığı qoydum Bentley'in önünə, şoferin tam yanına
Ala, sən bu otu Rolls Royce'da çəkə bilməzsən
Cüt köpük stəkan hələ də əlimdədir, içirəm, boşaldıram təkərlərə
Tək başıma sport maşındayam
5 yaşım olanda qapını təpikləmək məcburiyyətində qaldım
Köhnələri rəfdə saxlıyıram, 16 mərminin hamsı alov kimidir
Ciddən bezdim bu yalandan tətiyi çəkirmiş kimi davranan və osdurağa basan bu oğlanlardan
Bezdim tərzlərini mənim dostlarımdan alıb özləri yaradıbmış kimi davranmaqlarından
Həri, Cartier eynəklər, Cartier jaket, Cartier saat
Cartier sevgisidir bu, Cartier qəhbəsi
Yandan baxanda buynuza oxşuyan Cartier eynəkləri
Şahzadə kimi almazlar, Cartier olanından, həri
Cartier qəhbəsinə Cartier çanta
Wrangler sport maşını radara düşüb 200'lə
Cartier cinslər, əynimdən düşmür
Bu piyasada yıxılmağımın mümkünatı yoxdu
Yıxıla bilmərəm, oyundan çıxa bilmərəm
Ovucuma aldım arvadvın götünü və qapıya tərəf keçirdim
Çempion kimi otururam və vəd ediləni gözləyirəm
Təzə Chanel Patek'i özüm tənzimlədim
Yeni saatımla gəlirəm və heç qapını qırmıram
Yuxarı mərtəbəni çevirdim fahişəxanaya
100 minlər dəstə-dəstə, sel kimi basdıq
[Ara: Young Thug]
Nəğd pul, para, çeklər, nəğd
Adderall, Birkin, təptəzə uzun daraqlar
Tək başıma sikmək istəyirəm qancığı
Amma elə bayaq qardaşıma ötürdüm onu içdiyim Sprite kimi

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
504 Boyz kimi bombayam, lobidən keçirəm
Zaman dilimini xatırladım sizə, 2012'dən bu yana La Flame partladır
Masamda 100 milyon amma hələ də iş qərarları verməyə davam edirəm
Evimin qabağında yolda duran maşınlarımla bank hesabımdakı milyonlar arasındakı əlaqəni düşün
Mən tək başıma 4 qapılıdayam amma bil ki bayırda 100 dənə oğlan var
Ölümünə yanımdadılar, əmin ol
Gözəl illər keçirmişəm, yorulmaq mümkün deyil
İçimdən gələnləri eləməliyəm
Hər gün Super Bowl’du mənçün, sikim içini, yaxşı sən canı
Çox yük götürdüm çiynimə
Meydandayam, Odell kimi Richard Mille qolumdadı
Qız atdı əlini donuma bananımı ovuclamaq üçün
Geri gəlib dostlarımla əlaqəyə çıxmağım lazım oldu, 13 və 0 tərzində
Balama dedim ki, ""qızım, bu remix deyil, bu Sicko’nun bir hissəsidir""
Yox, biz eyni həyatı sürmürük, eyni işləri etmirik, eyni deyilik
Ana, mən uça bilirəm, problemlərim oldu amma hamsını çıxardım səmaya
Gətirdim mələkləri, bilirəm şeytan yoxlayacaq şansını
Çox isti oldu bura, elə bil bunu Paris Hilton dedi
Biz gələndə ziyan veririk, bu bizdən aslı deyil
Afterparty, Astroworld çıxdı piyasaya
Sərdim xəritəni ortaya, amma onlar bunu anlamadı
İş başına keçəndə bilirsən Grammy'ni götürərəm, həri!Embed"

Crank up the foreign, I swerve

Fucking this bitch like a perv'
Smack from the back, grab her perm
Ice, the berg, uh, shittin' on all you lil' turds
Can't take that dick, wait your turn
In my own lane, we can't merge
Suck with no hands, you can learn
Let's see how much you can earn
Watch me go big likе the Worm
And I ain't smokin' no sherm
I'm in this bitch with P Liity
QP, QP-ski
All of my bitches is prеtty, they showin' they titties, it's up to the ceilin'
I let her run through a million, I rock with her really, let's fuck on a billion
I'ma get down to the gritty, then fuck up the city, the home of the villains
Ecstasy, wonderful feelin'
Smoke out the pound when I'm chillin'
Trappin', I made me a killin'
Look, I got everybody wishin'

I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a Barbie, marking X on the dot
She calls my phone up, but I told her, ""I'm a loner"" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash

[Pre-Chorus]
But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)

Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo

When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes
Check my rolex they say I'm the man of the hour

Let me rap to you real quick
I wanna enjoy the luxury of like
Not knowing each other for real, hold up
Lotus flower bomb, firefly
When I'm low, she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love

[Verse 1: Wale]
Flower bomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb, huh, I'm tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil' vodka, whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty, where your baton? Racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell? I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend, be your nigga or a friend with perks
I'm just tryna work that, huh, they just tryna work your nerves
I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine
I'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity?
Tell me, would you care to be
My lady, my baby?

[Verse 2: Wale]
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind?
This is not no Sandra Bull', but you're Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much 'cause I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not, but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first, huh
Can I be with you just one night? I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tris
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy, baby, my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking, I ain't right, can't decide, but I can't fight
Easy, baby, you the bomb and all but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? Was it peace out? Can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right
With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name
It ain't important babe 'cause I'ma call you mine
[Chorus: Miguel & Wale]
We're living in a fantasy (Haha, Ralph)
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be

Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road

Girl the way you're movin'

Long hair she don't care
When she walk she get stares
Brown skin or a yellow-bone

So I'ma make it thunderstorm
Flood warning, Flocka yea
Blowin' fuck it I dont care
Dreads is flyin' everywhere
Tap my partner Roscoe, like bruh
I'm drunk as hell, can't you tell?
Threw 70 bands, bet 50 stacks
Oh fuckin' well
I'm tryna hit the hotel
With 2 girls that swallow me
Take this dick while I'm swallow
Moscato got her freaky
Hey you got me in a trance
Please take off yo pants
Pussy pop on her handstand
You got me sweatin'
Please pass me a fan, damn!

Don't let me just let up

Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high

If I'ma talk, I'ma talk, I'ma keep it real
Me and my boys, and my boys, we would split a pill
Noodles and pots in a pot was a nigga meal
Now that we on, that we on, we gon' split a mill'
I take a jet, take a jet when I'm overseas
None of my girls, of my girls gon' get over me
Shout-out to Hawk, shout-out Dooly, shout-out Hennessy
Them be my bros, be my bros 'til the death of me
Nobody, nobody know how I really be
I got some bars for a nigga if he wanna see
Dress up your talk if a nigga wanna talk to me
Fuck your phone calls, I don't want apologies
Everyone said, yeah, they said I was gonna peak
Most number ones, number ones in a nigga league
I think your girl, think your girl, fell in love with me
She say my fuck, and my tongue game a remedy

I think my nuts look better on her face
This bitch got addicted, all she did was take a taste
Now you gettin' mad because you got replaced
The brown boy and the Starboy on a track
Haters gonna say ""this shit is wack""
I went to the hills straight from the trap
I'ma fuck your bitch and give her back
She said she pop pills, I told her ""Stop it""
Check my little pocket, I got options
I'm the first brown boy to get it poppin'
If I say the word, my shooters gonna pop 'em

[Chorus]
Bad bitch (Bad)
Small waist, pretty face (Pretty)
Havin' my way (Havin', havin')
She let me nut on her face (Eugh)
Stay in your place (Stay in your)
Shut up and stay out the way (Shut up)
Decided what I'm gonna do today (What?)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith (Ghost)
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I wanna look at the stars today (Ghost)

[Verse 1]
I'ma ghost ride the Wraith
I'ma ghost ride like I'm from the Bay (Bay)
You better watch your bae
Better off doin' what Simon say (Say)
They mad 'cause I copped the Wraith
Police they look at my license plate (12)
They look at my jewelry
When I hop out, start singin' ""Amazing Grace"" (Grace)
The feast we eat
Before we jump in, my nigga we gotta say grace (got to)
My grandmama gone but can't be replaced (No)
Jenna, she paved the way (Jenna Lou)
I'm turnin' the page on niggas (Turnin')
I waited days, remember? (Waited)
Been had that fame on the side of my hood
Swear it couldn't change a nigga (How?)
You niggas are slow (Slow)
I can beat you runnin' backwards (Backwards)
The way I ghost ride the Wraith
Thought you would've seen Casper (Where)
No I ain't gon' hide the K
'Cause I know I'm who they after (Fuckin' bastard)
How much you charge a feature?
Extra twenty if you askin', gotta tax 'em

Reclinin' seats (Recline), pressin' one button, massagin' me (Massage me)

Fuck 12, nigga fast on feet (Fuck 12)
Cartel get the bag dirt cheap (Cartel)

Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
They be Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend

[Part 1: USHER & Lil Jon]
Bin im Club mit meinen Homies
Auf der Suche nach Sex, ohne Aufsehen zu erregen (Erregen)
Denn du weißt, wie es ist (Hey, hey)
Ich hab' diе Süße gesehеn, sie hat mich abgecheckt
Bei der Art, wie sie mir ins Ohr geflüstert hat, könnte man meinen, dass sie mich kennt (Kennt)
Ich hab' beschlossen, ruhig zu bleiben (Okay)
Die Unterhaltung wurde lauter (Hey)
Und ich hatte das Gefühl, sie ist bereit mir einen zu blasen
Pass auf! (Oh)
Pass auf!
Sie hat gesagt: „Komm, fang mich“ (Komm, fang mich)
Also bin ich aufgestanden und ihr auf die Tanzfläche gefolgt
Sie meinte: „Baby, los geht's“ (Los geht's)

Das Nächste, woran ich mich erinnere: Sie war auf mir und schrie
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Part 2: USHER, Lil Jon & Beide]
Jetzt schwirrt sie mir die ganze Zeit im Kopf rum
Sodass ich denke, es wär 'ne gute Idee, sie mit zu mir zu nehmen (Zu nehmen)
Denn sie ist bereit zu gehen (Bereit zu gehen; oh, los geht's)
Und jetzt muss ich ganz ehrlich sein (Ja)
Auf einer Skala von 1 bis 10 ist sie locker 'ne 20
Aber das bin ich einfach nicht (Hey)
Denn ich weiß nicht, wenn ich mein Glück versuche
Wohin das am Ende führt
Aber was ich weiß: Die Art, wie die sie tanzt
Macht die Süße in meinen Augen perfekt (Hey, hey, hey)
Wie sie runtergeht
Ich denk' mir so: „Ja, genauso kannst du das für mich auch machen“
Sie wollte noch eine Runde tanzen
Und ich so: „Ja, wie zur Hölle könnte ich jetzt gehen?“ Und ich meinte (Los geht's, bring den Beat zurück)

Schau hin, mein Outfit ist lächerlich
Im Club bin ich nicht zu übersehen
Und roar, diese Frauen sind alle auf Beutezug
Wenn du den Kopf still hältst, werd' ich die Kuh melken (Yeah)
Und vergiss das ganze Gelaber, jetzt mein' ich's ernst (Was?)
Ich werd' nicht aufhören, bis sie vor mir ist, wie Gott sie schuf (Yeah)
Also gib mir den Rhythmus und die Klamotten werden fliegen
Dann beug' ich dich nach vorne über und berühr' deine Zehen
Ich hab' den Jaguar stehen lassen und den Rolls-Royce genommen
Wenn sie nicht mit zu mir kommen, sollen sie eben zu Fuß gehen (Los geht's, oh!)
Was hältst du jetzt von mir
Wenn allein mein Ringfinger über 300.000 wert ist?
Lass uns trinken, ich versuch' es dir recht zu machen (Yeah)
Ludacris füllt Gläser/Körbe wie Doppel-D (Yeah)
Ich und Usher sind zurück und hinterlassen nichts als Asche
Wir wollen eine, die draußen elegant ist, aber ein Freak im Bett und schreit

Two things I never seen, a nigga named Bigfoot and a ho I need (Ho I need)
Keep the backdoor closed, gotta lock it, throw away the key (Throw away the key)
We can be a state away, U-turn if I ain't got my ski

Drac' hit, don't ask, we take shit
Like a blunt, we face shit (Come on)
Nigga lace shit, keep your shoes tight
Know some niggas tripped, they couldn't run right
You throw fits and we throw bullets out the stick, you a bitch, I'm a real nigga
He a mama boy, jumped off the porch, know a nigga had to babysit him, on God
Knock weight off a nigga like a BBL
Slide all day like a CDL ('L)
Heart skip a beat like a CD player (Player)
Fuck a classy bitch, I want a ratchet bitch, give me a city girl (Period)
I'm cappin', fuck, tell Dre I'm a shell, let a young nigga rock her world, come on (I'm serious)

On the street who got more killings? Know them pussies hate the feeling
Any way, I just made fifty K, spent thirty on my dentist
Upped a twenty on my image, like three K Wock' for my kidney
I was just broke than a bitch, now I have convos about business
Real estate and gaining interest, doubled up, ain't need a witness, uh
Think I'm a ho, come and show me, been ballin', Ginóbili, know killers that's Hoovers and Rollings
With this chopper, I shoot like I'm Kobe, so if you don't know me, it's best to walk light if you trollin'

No snakes in my grass 'cause I mow it, hell nah, I ain't goin', you kick that back door and I'm blowin'

Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her

Traumatized, hoping it don't rain no more
You done put me through some things that done changed my aura
Now all around the world, I explore, no Dora
New bitch, I might drip her in Dior
Ass fat, shawty straight heat, no Florida
Bad and she do it for herself, I applaud her

Yo, she fire
Brown skin, pretty brown eyes
Slim waist, but her hips kind of wide
Thick thighs, she about 5'5"", or about 5'6""
Pretty tits sittin' high, legs crossed when she sit
Hair was hangin' 'bout an inch, then she cut it off (Cut it off)
Eyebrows on fleek, can't rub it off, no pencil
Trap music in the Benz coupe, with the top down
No nigga, just a shih tzu
Bad bitch, she only smoke blunts with the glass tips
And she buy Chanel bags, just to put her cash in
Chanel thigh-high boots, stash the 380 (Stash the 380)
Money on her mind, she ain't thinkin' 'bout no baby (She ain't thinkin' 'bout no baby)
We used to sing Ashanti
""Baby, baby, ba-baby-y""
Now her mood is, ""Fuck you, pay me"" (Ooh)
Used to ride the bus (Uh), now she wear a bust down (Uh)
Now, it's a Clearport every time she touch down (Uh)
When they throwin' shade, she just make a touchdown (Score)
Scorin' on you hoes, she real life goals

[Chorus: Relle Bey]
Shorty got her own car and her own crib (Own crib)
She don't take no handouts, she don't owe shit (Ooh, ooh)
Shorty pay her own bills, buy her own drip (Drip, drip)
I can't keep my hands off her, 'cause she so thick (Ooh, ooh)
Bust her wrist down, baby, you the coldest (Ooh, ooh)
She don't gold-dig 'cause it ain't her motive (Yeah, yeah)
She gon' push the drugs just to keep her loaded (Oh-whoa)
Got it out the mud and I had to notice
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin' (Never need a nigga for nothin')
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin', no (No, never need a nigga)
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever, need a nigga for nothin' (She ain't never need a nigga for nothin')

Never, ever need a nigga for nothin', no (No, no, never need a nigga)

But she so damn precious, my lil' baby, she be splurgin'

She a shootin' star, she the one I been searchin' for
She don't need no man (Uh)
A nigga is a dub, can't get no love from her (Ooh)
He don't know her worth (Uh)
Shorty is a queen (Uh)
These hoes can't fuck with her

[Verse 3: Young M.A]
Shorty ain't never need a nigga, she ain't stressin'
Face on godly, body on blessin'
Yeah, she got friends, but her money is her best friend
She already winnin', now she workin' on her next win
Independent women, I salute you
Mami stand out, she ain't neutral
Never goin' broke, she refuse to
New bags, new do, new you
Big body Benz when she cruise through
Out with the old, in with the new new
She'll have you hooked, pussy on voodoo
She'll have you cuckoo for the coo-coo
Gel on her nails, color on Blue's Clues
She stay on vacay, boomerang new views
Playlist with the new tunes
Fuck what ya last nigga did
Baby, do you (Woo)

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gon' always be together, baby
That's what you told me and I believe it
'Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

[Verse 1: Bow Wow, Ciara]
Now, I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen them all but ain't none of them at all (Like you)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (Like you)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl, then she gotta be just (Like you)
And baby, that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we, first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kinda guy to try to dog you out, but
I ain't that kinda guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned to my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady cause baby, you know

[Chorus: Ciara & Bow Wow]

Your love is amazing to me
I can't wait 'til I see you - I wanna be with you again

And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)
That I'm your main chick who got that game chick
One and the same chick - the one you can hang with

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
Okay, when you hit the mall, pop tags spend a few G's
Hit the runway to a new season
It ain't nothin', I spoil the one I care for
Feel like I ain't doin' enough, that's when I shared more
I give you dis, give you dat, what you need, love?
You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job, but I do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go
I get wit you when I can, so that's how I let you know
And you be trippin' 'cause sometimes I gotta go
But you the first one I holla to right after my shows
And I was trippin' in a sense, I was tense
But my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you
I gotta get it together, say whatever
But since I met you, my life seem so better

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done ""specially invited guest""'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, ""Let's be out""
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me (With me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy then to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (With me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go

Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before

I've dug two graves for us, my dear

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Lately, I feel so alone
Don’t even know why I have a phone
Nobody hits me up and I’m stuck, never had someone that I could call my–own
It’s lonely walking down this road
Fake friends that I didn’t have to know
The same ones that fucked me over and whenever I need 'em and I turn around they just turn–ghost
I feel I’m at an all-time low
I am depressed and it hurts me to know
My ex is happy and I can’t seem to cope
She’s ignoring every text message I wrote
My anxiety’s high, my medication’s low
I am so stressed and I hate being home
I sit and overthink everything alone
I wish I had somebody to hold, damn
I’m sick and tired of putting up a front
Like I’m happy, but really I am in a slump
I try to stay strong, screaming, “I don’t give a fuck!”
But if anybody would give it, then I'm the one
I wanna put down my walls and open up
I hide behind this rapper I’ve become
Addicted to bein' accepted’s like a drug
No one’s here, I feel like I’m ready to plunge
I remember you said my music was wack
Teachers persuading me to try to give up my act
They said the image and the drive is what I lack
Made me think maybe I could never be a part of rap
Well, I ignored that, I said, ""Fuck it,"" and snapped
Over twenty million plays, where are my haters at?
I didn’t need a label to give me a chance
The day I sell out an arena I'll feel like I’m the man
Buzzin' hard, but to find nothing
Never found someone who really loves me
People comin' around now 'cause I’m gettin' money
A few plays later, now they all see something
The same guy that is from the start
The same guy my ex left with a broken heart
The same guy who turned music into his art
The same seven-year-old who dreamt of bein' a star
I’m twenty-two, and I won’t let myself down
I stood up right after I fell down
It’s hard to see Heaven when you know you're Hell-bound
I never really opened up and that’s until now
I hope that I never lose you
If I could choose one person, I would choose you
I hope you understand my pain
'Cause that’s something that we all gotta go– through

I hate being down this road
Been down before
I feel like I need you more

My future’s all I’d imagine
And now I’m here and I look back, I’m screamin', ""Damn it""

No, I never planned it38Embed"

Big dog status, Bal Harbour

Goyard bag, tote the cutter
I got it out the field, fuck Russell
Go and ask Lori about the Patek
Then go and ask Joie and ask Dess

It's a habit trickin' on a bitch
Shit, I'm thinkin' I could've been a pimp
Shit, I'm cookin' up dope like it's dinner
Shit, I come from Zone 6, nigga trim
Shit, I'm floatin', I'm higher than a blimp
Shit, it look like I'm swimmin' in glass
Shit, I turn up my bitch 'cause she bad
Shit, I'm makin' her ex-nigga mad
Shit, they go for that bag, I'ma spaz
Real nigga alert, I'm securin' the bag
Pipin' a bitch, it ain't nothin', I got cash
Turn up the shooters with switches, go bad
Stay with some scammers, my dog movin' packs
Trappin' to rappin', my dog, he fall off, no cappin', I'm buyin' him a brick
Fuck on your bitch, then I told her to call off, actually, I'm makin' her quit
Painkillers got my lil' demons on go, they ready to hit with the stick

Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need them (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater

Well, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stakes for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
But way more error (Huh)

[Verse 1]
Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spinned for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' lot of cappin', watch whеn I catch you, I'ma whack you in front the witness

[Chorus]
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could'vе been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars

Remember when we was jackin' cars

I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Kutthroat business, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get loud, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm off probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen nothin' yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me
I be on a fuck nigga ass like Charmin
AK, twenty-inch carbon

[Chorus]
We could've been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
[Post-Chorus]
Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch
When I slide, nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

[Outro]
—Glass
Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)
But I'm pretty sure our time is up (Now your time is up)
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial
But way more error
I ain't slimy, I'm grimy
Any way you put it, I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin
Snatch and grab, sneak and geek, Sniper Gang, trust
Nightmare, baby, you know I—
I bet you always see me in your dreams

Ooh

[Verse 1: Diana Gordon]
Imagine life, imagine life without me, it's a waste of time
You want the kind of love that can make a child
Don't want just anybody (Not just anybody, not just anybody) Ooh
Good love fill my body up like a glass when you pour it all out
If you know me, you know I mind, someone like me is hard to find
No mistakin' if I am there, well aware you are always mine
And still you seem so surprised, always gon' be mine

[Chorus: Diana Gordon with Lil Yachty]
I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away, you drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
And I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away, you drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, losе it

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Imagine me circlin' through life without a piеce of you
Seven out of seven days I'm needin' you
You bring life to the party
(Ooh, ah-ha, ooh, ah-ha-ha)
Good love feels like butterflies suffocatin' your insides, oh
It's a late night, you know I try, I cannot picture when you lie
I'm mistaken thinkin' you were taken, knowin' that you were always mine
And still I feel so surprised, you're always gon' be mine

Rarely ever missin', talk is cheap and time is tickin'
Rarely ever trickin', catch me slippin', that pussy was leakin'
I'm on missions, payin' millions, I'm Ted DiBiase, uh, God
Out late night, I'm sinnin', still a Christian, don't tell my deacon
I mean pastor, or I'll go down there, talkin' faster
Ride around, six-seven bitches with no tint, you can see I'm pimpin'
Big four-five on my hip, like I'm limpin', never simpin'
One of my cousins crippin', always grippin', shit get dangerous
Always keep it player, we can swap out hoes, I'm never trippin'
I love my mother, my sister, my daughter

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Broke up with my girl last night so I went to the club (So I went to the club)
Put on a fresh white suit and the mini-coupe sittin' on dubs (Sittin' on dubs)
I'm just lookin' for somebody to talk to and show me some love (Show me some love)
If you know what I mean, uh-huh
Everybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot (I stepped in the spot)
Two hundred bitches in the building, ain't none of them hot (Ain't none of them hot)
Except for this pretty young thang that was workin' all the way at the top (On the way, at the top)
Shawty, what is your name?

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Ooh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk
And I think she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We hit it off somethin' proper like

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I like the bartender (Ooh, if you lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (Oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)
I like the bartender (Yeah, if you lookin' for me)

I'm just keepin' it real, uh-huh
Baby still workin' at the club so I'm gettin' in free (So I'm gettin' in free)
Wednesday night, I'm on the list, T-Pain plus three (T-Pain plus three)
Every time I hit the spot babygirl takin' care of me (Takin' care of me)
How do you think I feel?

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Ooh, she made us drinks to drink, we drunk 'em, got drunk
And now I know she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We gon' have fun at my spot tonight

[Verse 3: Akon & T-Pain]
Shorty, I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out (Ever come out)
'Less I'm in the M6, doin' tricks, freeway burnt out (Freeway burnt out)
Got a passenger side that's empty wantin' it to be your spot (Be your spot)
Put you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top (And I end up on top)
Don't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby (Baby)
Just lookin' at you from a distance, lookin' like a goddamn star baby (Baby)
So my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car? (Those keys to the car)
'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorrow (I'll see you tomorrow)

[Chorus]
A nigga came from the bottom, down below
'Member them cold nights, I was sleepin' on the floor
Always dreamed about the Forgiato feet, now they down below
A nigga got so much money on me, I can't count no more

[Verse 1]
'Member I was in the project walls, couldn't even get a loan
Now these niggas got they hands out, if I ain't give it, I'd be wrong
'Member I was in the county jail none of these bitches wasn't pickin' up the phone
Now they bangin' my line, I ain't got time no more
A nigga started from the bottom, now I'm livin'
Early morning, uncle whippin' in the kitchen
Some people said I couldn't do it and then I did it
Look at my bank account, I'm runnin' up the digits
I ain't into all that ""Doin'-that-facade"" shit
I walk it, I talk it, I live it
Come to the bird house, look at the garage, nigga
My Bentley coupe got a couple pigeons
I was down on my ass, had to go a new direction
Bought mom a Gucci purse, gave her 10 racks, told her you ain't gotta stress it
It ain't even an emergency and a nigga 'bout to pull up in a 911
Just to feed my dawgs, I told God it's a blessin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Roddy Ricch, yeah, I never took the safe route
Nigga came from the bottom, I had to make it out
I was trappin' in the box, I had to break out
Hurt my soul when the feds kicked down the vacant house
Black truck on the corner, they had a stakeout
Seen a dopeboy pullin' out a Wraith out
Had to get up out the hood to the lake house
The head chef 'bout to bring my steak out
I was pourin' up the liters, swipin' them Visas
They think a nigga Rondo 'cause I always kept a Nina
Now my jewelry wetter than Aquafina, quick trip to Catalina
White bitch bad as Selena, fuck her, then a nigga gotta leave
I just wanna shine like the Wraith roof stars 'cause a nigga been down so long
Ain't nobody see, bird vision, dawg, got it all on our own
'Member them nights I was trappin', I was trappin' all night long
Now I keep a shooter on the right, just in case a nigga try to do me wrong (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Young Money)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl (Kane is in the building, nigga)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

[Verse 4: Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her
[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

DaVinci (DaVinci, DaVinci)
Yeah
Shoutout the whole Oakland City, man
You know what I'm saying? The whole 4PF
Know what I'm saying? I put this up
Yeah

[Verse]
Shoutout my label, that's me
I'm in this bitch with TB
I'm in this bitch with 4 Trey
I just poured up me an eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no ho
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain’t my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
'Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gon' fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta that when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos on Dracos on Dracos on Dracos
40s on 40s on 40s
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil' nigga, but I'm big, dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Get a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lurkin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryna guess what I'm doin'
They tryna guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit

Hold up
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun

Yeah, cause real niggas just want (haaaaa)
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing
Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king)
Seems like the ones who roam never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)
In the literal sense, I mean the physical sense
I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that
I heard you (bad girl)
And I'm tellin' you I could believe that
Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous
But we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got the league pass

And Rihanna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya (splashhhh)

Enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost

You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion

Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it but just know it workin' for me
She text me ""I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you""
But how the fuck can you hate me?

Flocka!

[Chorus]
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stinking, nigga, what the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say
Front yard, broad day with the SK
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the 'Dale with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga (Flocka!)

[Verse 1]
Got a main bitch (And?) got a mistress (What else?)
A couple girlfriends, I'm so hood-rich
Keep my dick hard (Yeah) and keep me smoking
You'll get bills free, shawty, no joking (Real talk)
And what I stand for? (Flocka!) Brick Squad (Brick Squad)
I'ma die for this shawty, man, I swear to God
In the trap with some killers and some hood niggas
Where you at? Where you trap? You ain't hood, nigga (Bow!)
Keep this shit 300, put that shit on my hood (Flocka)
Crips fucking with me, G's and the Vice Lords (Brrrrrrr)

Two years later, screaming: ""Now I'm here, your honor!""

Shawty, point blank range, I'll put your ass to sleep
Shawty, talk is cheap, so watch what you say
Broad day in the air like this shit legal (Flocka!)

With my thing cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (Yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (Yeah)

Tonight I can't sleep, we livin' in Hell (Chea)
First they give us the work, then they throw us in jail (Ay)
Road trip, yeah, I'm traffickin' the white
Please Lord, don't let me go to jail tonight (Yeah)
Who me? I'm a soul survivor

I ain't cheat, played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself (Let's get it)
No nuts, no glory (No glory)
My biography, you damn right, the true story
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ay)

Cause if you lookin' for me
You can find me on the block disobeyin' the law

[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
Let me tell you I'm conceited, bitch, I don't need a bitch
They be begging me to breed a bitch, but I can't keep a bitch
You know me, right after I beat it bitch, Imma leave it, bitch
I ain't even with the screaming shit, Imma freeze a bitch
Then ask Monte where my sneakers went, with the Bimmer whip
Shooting niggas front of Keisha crib, right where Keisha live
Homie, tell me if you need a shift, I'm at Rita crib
CC2's like every weekend, bitch, ain't no sleeping this
Let me tell you 'bout my reckless life
I was selling white, homies 'bout to cause some wreck tonight
Ain't no check tonight, police looking for us left to right
Ain't no rest tonight, we on the run until the check is right
You get the message, aight?

[Chorus: Rowdy Rebel]
Now what you know about that kitchen life
When we was pitching white?
People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right
I told Bobby keep that pistol tight the way we living life
Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life
Now what you know about that kitchen life

Shit, watch me take off, I'm a fool, I'm a dog
I'm a nigga that make music for a job
I'll drop a bomb on your beat but it costs
Nigga, what you thought? Bitch, I'm Rowdy, I go hard (Rowdy baby)
With 30 bands then I blow it on the squad
Give a little bit of shmoney to my moms
Remember when that nigga used to jugg and rob?
Now we living large

[Chorus]
Woke up this morning, can't remember nothing
Two bitches just flew in from London (Two bitches)
Last thing I remember they callin' me daddy
The mattress was covered in money (In hunnids)
Went to sleep with my jewelry and chains on
Had to wake up and recount the money (Recount it)
I got a bitch, she gon' kill for real, talk about Clyde and Bonnie (Brr)

[Post-Chorus]
Coupe with the kit, cop it (Got to)
Pull up with a stick, stop it (Stop it)
Rich nigga shit, solid (Rich nigga)
Old hunnids, pockets rotted (Cottage)
I go to space with the stars (Stars)
Might smoke a blunt with my pilot (Cookie)
Saturn, Moon, Earth, and Mars (Mars)
NASA takeoff with the rocket (NASA)

[Verse]
Half a million on a necklace (A half)
Young rich niggas we successful (Successful)
Said she wanna feel special (She what)
That coco make her feel special (Coco)
I count a hunnid or better (One hunnid)
Back end two hunnid or better (Two hunnid)
I might go put all my chains on (Ice)
I just might change up the weather (Change it)
She pop a perc, her pussy wetter (Drip)
I met the bitch at Coachella (Coachella)
If she knew, tell her she'd probably do better
But can I get a E for effort? (E)
I prayed to God to wash my sins (God)
Nothing formed against me, not a weapon (No weapon)
Ask Him where do I begin (Where?)
Devil tryna take my blessings (My blessings)
They don't know the meaning of the white (Naw)
You don't really live this life (No)
Niggas in the hood shootin' twice (Pew pew)
See my niggas in the hood shoot precise (Brr)
Real wise, we ain't taking no advice (Naw)
I realize that these hoes ain't right (All of 'em)
Don't even ask, 'cause they know what's the price (Price)
Ain't gotta snow, they already know it's white (White)
I talk to God cause I been baptized (Baptized)
I got mob ties to the nawf side (Nawf side)
Pull up with the sticks on the niggas, straight slime (Skrt-Skrt)

I had no other choice 'cause we ain't own this shit (Real)
You know that janky shit, I'm not condoning it (Nah)
I'm with a couple niggas, I got a bone to pick (Real)
I'm on some movement shit, y'all on some moment shit (Huh)
But I'll be here forever, y'all can go and quit
We had bad bitches in a new Bentley
Just re-upped from that new stimmy
My brother countin' them blue Benjis
Only feel good when my crew with me, like woah
They tried to question my character
Young, rich, and Black, they hate me in America
We some real niggas, don't fit the criteria
Don't like your vibe, not allowed in my area
I entered this game and I came here to change it
Speak my beliefs, now they calling me dangerous
Takin' the throne and I'm gonna maintain it
I gotta go down as just one of the greatest (Huh)
So anybody got a problem with me
Can't fake kick it, fuck your politicking (Fuck)
I ain't worried 'bout it, I know God is with me (Amen)
And your piece of mind is worth a dollar fifty, but (Lord)
[Chorus]
Last year, I made seven million
Didn't have to do a single fuckin' show
Shout out to my niggas up at Coca-Cola
For the check they cut me at the Super Bowl
All my life moments is a super woah
My nigga Dr. Dre, he got a super boat
Last night, I was textin' Jack Dorsey
That's the perks you get from being super dope

5. New Kids on The Block - ""80's Baby"" (for its forced 80s references, and nostalgia theme, deeming it to be 'Buzzfeed: The Song' and that the Stopera brothers - editors for the website - would orgasm to the song)

4. Meghan Trainor - ""Let You Be Right"" (for being yet another pop throwback, Meghan's controlling, militant attitude, and being another toxic relationship song)

3. 6ix9ine ft. Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz - ""FEFE"" (for being another generic SoundCloud rap song, containing weird references to prison sex toys and contraband, potential references to 6ix9ine's real-life crimes and Nicki's strange performance and lyricism related to STDs)

2. Lil Pump - ""EEESKITT"" (like 'FEFE' - more generic SoundCloud rap, weird instrumental and performance, Pump's enunciation of words and nonsensical slang)

1. Iggy Azalea ft. Tyga - ""Kream"" (for having an incoherent and nonsensical hook, messy lyrics and a soulless performance from both artists; Iggy was especially criticised for releasing bad music despite a clear decline in her popularity and her peaking with ""Fancy"")

Honorable Mentions

G-Eazy & Halsey - Him & I (for its irony in the context of the artists' consequent split)

Drake - I'm Upset (for being gutless a rap song)
Ariana Grande ft Nicki Minaj - The Light is Coming (for Grande's lazy, cringe-worthy rap-singing)

Pink ft Elton John and Logic - Bennie and The Jets (for adding a rap verse to the song)

Tyga - Dip (for exemplifying the same pop rap tropes, like 'Kream')

Ella Mai- Boo'd Up (for its ""hook"" that consists of onomatopoeia instead of an actual verse)

Greeta Van Fleet - (for lying about not sounding like Led Zeppelin, despite the lead vocalist's jarring similarities to Robert Plant's singing)Embed"

Visions of my past, I seen delight in love
Frequency was low, I had to rise above
Searching deep inside, I think I found the plug
Take me as I am if for not who I was
Let's pick up ourselves and we put down the guns
Let's uplift our women, they the chosen ones
Hope I get my flowers 'fore my day'll come
This that typa truth to make your body numb
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
Why must we steal, must we hate, must we lie?
People they oppress, they depressed out their mind

[Verse]
Dearly beloved, I was made for this, damn
I worked them nights just like a slave for this, yuh
Giving all my love and all my pain for this
It ain't no game with this
I'm in my lane
I'm not in a tank 'cause they ain't saying shit
I'm in my bag and I'm gon' spaz in case you do forget
Yeah, he cool and they ok but can't compare to this
I'm on my exodus, black is excellence
Speak my testament, check off my bucket list
Know what time it is, my whole body chill
My life super real, blessings too familiar
Switching my ways to better my days
I found me a queen, the one of my dreams
I'm living on high, outta the cage
Outta the shell, into myself
Living the life, living in health
Living in God, building the wealth
Niggas who pity party on the boulevard
And they gon' switch up on you when you step
Niggas'll take, take, take, take
They'll take it all till there's nothing left
I done seen home boys with they straight face
Pissed off 'cause it ain't them
Losing your focus, you hitting the rim
I'm in the studio, I'm in the gym
I got the F on the top of the brim
I'm on a level opposite of them
I'm the front of hunned dollar tip
I got no chains on in the vip
I like the round bottoms with the hips
I got a humble vibe but I'm him
I got a hunned loading in the crib
I got some more stored in the whip

She so thick, it's kinda hard to say skinny dip (Ooh)

Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying ""Fuck you,"" ""I miss you,"" or ""I hate you so much""
'Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say ""Be real,"" I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, ""Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?

But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I

Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it

And your girlfriends, but being that she's a big fan, of course she made it
Most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill, they chase it
But you, just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous
So I just name a time and a place and your game for it
Value player, hotel room, meet you there

It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from D.C., that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him

Tell Lucian I said ""fuck it,"" I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, ""Butterfly it, she'll love it.""
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'

Honestly, I'm just tryna be, I just gotta be
Tryin' to get over on anything, they tellin' lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't gettin' on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me

Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you fallin' off your feet

Tore off the bow in a Bentley, fucking your ho in her kidney
Fuck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (To watch our life together)
You just like going to Heaven (My heart)
Oh, where are you taking me? (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
I'm fallin' and I'm drownin'
But you're takin' me

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
One thousand on my feet, stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (Eyes)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' no FaceTime
Fifty K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldеned by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Late from thе country caters
No peacemaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
I need no beef, no cheese (Yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (Uh)
Every time we meet, naive

When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (To watch our life together)
You just like going to Heav— (My heart)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
One thousand on my feet, stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (Eyes)

[Verse 2: Sampha]
Yeah, it's mad how it gets so deep
It's mad how I get so high
It's mad how you get me by (By)

[Outro]
Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Part II]

[Intro]
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me a smile (Hah)
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it for miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror (That shit wild)
I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink29Embed"

Double up
Three or four times, I ain't tellin' no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (Yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three, two
That's time I got to you
That money, my dreams come true
My life in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Turned seven to a fourteen
Fourteen to a whole thing
Lord knows it's a cold game
Switched up on you hoes, man
Big body take both lanes
Backseat, blowin' propane
All-black, five gold chains
Young rich nigga bossed up on his own, man
My new shit sound like it's ""Soul Train""
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain
RSC, we for sure bang
Tiny Locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the '80s? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
But you drove to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they quotes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix with my sack for the whole day
Drive-bys, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school, play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage
Tryna

I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three, two
That's time I got to you
That money, my dreams come true
My life in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Post-Chorus: Belly & DOM KENNEDY]
I'd leave it behind if you let me
Ironic, I'd drown just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I bring you up, you just let me down
Let me down (Uh, let me down)
(Need my All Money In chain too)
Let me down (Woah, let me down, look out, look out)

[Verse 2: DOM KENNEDY]
It's hard to catch what you can't see
I grew up to be who I wanna be, so
The more niggas talk, I'ma shine
Might've been way before its time
Posted with my back against the wall
Life is a bitch, but she mine
The rag six-deuce, yeah, it's mine
The Westside too, yeah, it's mine
What you know about
Your poster on the wall at the dealership?
Leave her in the bed, legs tremblin'
Gettin' banged on for your Pendletons
What you know about
Your response be the reason you exist?
Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip, so
As the champagne spill
And the car accelerate and the beat gon' cry
I be goin' to the bank at least three, four times
Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut
[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Belly]
Double up (Yeah)
Three or four times, I ain't tellin' no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Double up
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just (Yeah)
I ain't tellin' no lies, I just
Five, four, three, two
That's time I got to you
That money, my dreams come true
My life in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew?
Who knew?

[Post-Chorus: Belly]
I'd leave it behind if you let me
Ironic, I'd drown just to hold you down
I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I bring you up, you just let me down

But the crazy thing is, I began one
All-white bricks
I’m straight like it’s jumping back to 36, nigga
Big house, long hallways
Got 10 bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga
See Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $99You might also like[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And we don't want no problems
Okay, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street, ooh
Now, pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Whoa, Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
What the fuck is up? (Up) It’s Gucci Mane the G (S'Gucci)
Ask Tity Boi, no pity, boy; this scar city, the city boy (What?)
So Icy; so, no Nike, boy, just Gucci, Louis, Prada, 'scuse me ('Scuse me)
""Gucci Mane keep shittin' on me, why that boy keep buying jewelry?"" (Kane is in the buildin', nigga)
East Atlanta cockin' hammers, bandannas on car antennas (Ugh)
No, we do not talk to strangers, just cut off these niggas' fingers (Huh)
Gucci's armed and dangerous, cocaine, codeine and angel dust
This AK-47 will hit ya anywhere from the ankle up (Ankle)
Gun same size as Nia Long, clip long as a Pringles can (Damn)
4-5 Desert Eagle on me, you'll think I'm a Eagles fan (Huh)
Toni Braxton sniper rifle, make you never breathe again (Hah)
Fuck that nigga, kill that nigga, bring him back, kill him again (Gucci)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, the-the-the money is the motive
Fuck with the money, it get ugly as Coyote
""Okay, I’m reloaded,"" better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound, break it down, and put it in a stogie
Swagger so bright, I don’t even need light
I’m with a model broad, she don’t even eat rice, ha
But, would you believe it? She eat dykes
And she asked me for a picture, so I gave her three strikes, yeah
I-I’m the man around this mothafucka
I’m so hot, you probably catch a tan around this mothafucka
This rap game, I got my hand around this mothafucka
Yeah, I said ""game,"" but I ain’t playin' around this mothafucka
Yeah! I’m the best to ever do it, bitch, haha
And you’re the best at never doin' shit
If you the shit, then I'm sewerage
Try me and I'll have your people reading eulogies, haha
I swear, you can't fuck with me
But I can fuck your girl, and make her nut for me, then slut for me
Then kill for me, then steal for me, and of course, it'll be your cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to your ass
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And we don't want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street, ooh
Now, pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Whoa, Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, man, suck my clip
Swallow my bullets, and don’t you spit, ughhhh
I am the hip-hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I’m all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this? I will make the most of this
""F"" is for ferocious, murder your associates
The top is so appropriate, this is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for your girlfriend to wobble on, Weez'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And we don't want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?

You know Lil Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it
Real as it get and these niggas be fakin', I don't want they vibes, so they hand I ain't shakin'

Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, ""Stop breathin'""
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em

[Strophe 1: 6LACK]
Nimm es nicht persönlich
Du weißt, ich weiß, dass es wehtut zu geh'n
Trage das Gewicht und ich ignoriere den Schmerz
Das könnte viel kosten, verlange es von dem Spiel
Werd' den Kampf nicht vermissen, aber ich weiß, du wirst mich vermissen
Ich hoffe nur, du bekommst das Gefühl, mich küssen zu wollen

[Pre-Refrain: 6LACK]
Wir brechen, dann schütteln, nichts Falsches, du hast mich zum Lächeln gebracht
Sonne, Regеn oder Schnee, Mädchen, ich will dich bei mir habеn

[Refrain: Don Toliver]
Deshalb weiß ich, dass ich dich nicht aufgeben kann (Oh)
Meistens ist es vorübergehend
Die meisten Mädchen sind vorübergehend
Die meisten Gefühle sind vorübergehend
Diesmal nicht
Diesmal kann ich dich nicht—
Deshalb weiß ich, dass ich dich nicht aufgeben kann (Oh)
Meistens ist es vorübergehend
Die meisten Mädchen sind vorübergehend
Die meisten Gefühle sind vorübergehend

Diesmal kann ich dich nicht— (Yeah)

Karma beschäftigt mich, also sprich nicht schlecht über uns
Schlechte Eigenschaften, die auf uns bellen, kann ich nicht tolerieren
Wir geh'n getrennte Wege und machen weiter, gebrochene Herzen für uns
Hab' Patrón für uns, ja, atme ein, dann atme aus
Neue Verbindungen und neue Regeln für mich selbst, greife nach innen und strecke dich nach außen
Sobald ich aus dem Schlitten steige

[Pre-Refrain: 6LACK]
Wir brechen, dann schütteln, nichts Falsches, du hast mich zum Lächeln gebracht

Grove Street
Flocka

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I stepped in the club, rolling up that loud shit
My weed keep your security saying, ""Be quiet""
My bread just start a riot, the girls get excited
Hold on, want to try it? I'm like, ""Why not try it?""
My swag, they want to buy it, my juice, they want to try it
Club going stupid, when I O Let's Do It
Jewelry got her chewing, jugging and she moving
Grove Street villain, nigga, who you killing?
Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jacksons to the ceiling, that's how we balling
You know that I'm rolling, throwing up a mean bag
Now I'm off the meter, in the club with a heater

I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

[Verse 2: Kebo Gotti]
A party ain't a party till I walk in it
Lime green flag match the fitted and the linen
Gucci shades are on my face and my lens kind of tinted
'Cause my eyes real low and my head just started spinning
I'm rolling like a motherfucker, I'ma roll out in this motherfucker
On my Roscoe Dash shit, I'm 'bout to show out in this motherfucker
My jewelry game on frost, about to snow out in this motherfucker
Ay, Flocka, get them burners, let's pull out in this motherfucker
Ay, motherfucker, what the hell is you rocking for?
Run up on me and my squad, now that shouldn't be an option, so
Somebody better let him know, I suggest that you let it go
This is Grove Street party, safe niggas, hit the exit door

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Rolling off them beans, you can do the lean
Blowing on that loud purp, pass that Bobby Brown back
The hood got my fucking back, the streets, I'm not ducking that
Please step the fuck back, Grove Street, yes, we are back
Hood plus I'm nigga rich, every ghetto feeling this
20 on my right wrist, 30 on my left wrist
100 on my neck, I'll die for my respect
20-fucking-10, I'ma blow the whole check
In the club, flex, after party, flex
You know how we ball, all I know is ball
Every dollar in my pocket, I'ma spend it all
When a nigga die, they gon' say shawty raw

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping, that's why the bad hoes jocking
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party4Embed"
